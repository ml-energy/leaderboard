This faculty creates nothing. It merely works with the material of experience, education, and observation with which it is fed.\nIt is the faculty used most by the inventor, with the exception of the who draws upon the creative imagination, when he cannot solve his problem through synthetic imagination.\nCreative Imagination\nThrough the faculty of creative imagination, the finite mind of man has direct communication with Infinite Intelligence.\nIt is the faculty through which \u201chunches\u201d and \u201cinspirations\u201d are received. Through this skill all basic, or new ideas are handed over to man.\nIt is through this faculty that thought vibrations from the minds of others are received. Through this power one individual may \u201ctune in,\u201d or communicate with the subconscious minds of other men.\nThe creative imagination works automatically. This faculty functions ONLY when the conscious mind is vibrating at an exceedingly rapid rate, as for example, when the conscious mind is stimulated through the emotion of a strong desire.\nThe creative faculty becomes more alert, more receptive to vibrations from the sources mentioned, in proportion to its development through USE. This statement is significant! Ponder over it before passing on.\nThe great leaders of business, industry, finance, and the great artists, musicians, poets, and writers became great, because they developed the faculty of creative imagination.\nBoth the synthetic and creative faculties of imagination become more alert with use, just as any muscle or organ of the body develops through use.\nDesire is only a thought, an impulse. It is nebulous and ephemeral. It is abstract, and of no value, until it has been transformed into its physical counterpart.\nCreative visualization, manifesting, and the law of attraction use the imagination to create success."}]}, {"id": "NyEgDRQ_0", "conversations": [{"from": "human", "value": "please generate a sales plan to motivate and measure sales staff"}]}, {"id": "LRfDpOa_0", "conversations": [{"from": "human", "value": "Look at the page for https://carlottasvillage.com/ we are planning a sequence of newsletters.

All of the following will fund the protocol in the long run.\n3-8% on the LP to ensure ample liquidity when buying or selling.\n5%-10% Risk-Free Value, which will hedge against volatility in the market to ensure stability in the price of #Endgame.\nSee the taxes breakdown section for further information.\nThe issue with conventional taxing\nWhile taxing the protocol at a fixed amount has an effect on sell pressure, a lot of whales in the protocol can afford to lose some of their tokens when doing price manipulation. This causes the protocol to have massive price volatility which whales use to shake off retail to buy a bigger share in the treasury. This causes the protocol to not only become unsustainable but also unfriendly to the average investor, who makes the core of every project. To mitigate this problem, we've implemented the Dynamic Tax.\nDynamic taxes\nWhat are dynamic taxes?\nDynamic taxes are an innovative concept, which aims to minimize price manipulation by taxing sales/wallet transfers additionally based on how big of a share the holder has in correlation to the LP of #Endgame. This means that somebody with a lot of tokens in the ecosystem cannot dump the market without leaving a share of it in the hands of the community, making future attempts harder and harder. How many #Endgame tokens you hold is taken into account when calculating how big of a share of the LP you hold. For every 1% that you hold, the tax is increased by 1% until there's a total dynamic sell tax of 10%.\nA simple calculation:\n1% of LP - 1% tax\n2% of LP - 2% tax\n3% of LP - 3% tax\n4% of LP - 4% tax\nso on and so forth.\nThis tax does not affect the ordinary buyer because of the sheer volume of LP one would need to have to make such a share possible.\nWhy did Endgame implement this tax?\nPrevious rebase tokens have been repeatedly manipulated, leaving the rest of the community with losses that cannot be recovered through simple staking. We're dealing with the PY issue through taxes. We believe that, whereas the other protocols believed that blacklisting had valid justification, we do not intend to do so. So, thanks to the concept, we're adding on top of taxing entry and exits by innovating the mechanic by creating tax brackets to reduce the frequency of these problems."}]}, {"id": "qZqbKc3_26", "conversations": [{"from": "human", "value": "Great.

Each game contains many rounds; in each round, the players each simultaneously choose one of Rock, Paper, or Scissors using a hand shape. Then, a winner for that round is selected: Rock defeats Scissors, Scissors defeats Paper, and Paper defeats Rock. If both players choose the same shape, the round instead ends in a draw.\n\nAppreciative of your help yesterday, one Elf gives you an encrypted strategy guide (your puzzle input) that they say will be sure to help you win. \"The first column is what your opponent is going to play: A for Rock, B for Paper, and C for Scissors. The second column--\" Suddenly, the Elf is called away to help with someone's tent.\n\nThe second column, you reason, must be what you should play in response: X for Rock, Y for Paper, and Z for Scissors. Winning every time would be suspicious, so the responses must have been carefully chosen.\n\nThe winner of the whole tournament is the player with the highest score. Your total score is the sum of your scores for each round. The score for a single round is the score for the shape you selected (1 for Rock, 2 for Paper, and 3 for Scissors) plus the score for the outcome of the round (0 if you lost, 3 if the round was a draw, and 6 if you won).\n\nSince you can't be sure if the Elf is trying to help you or trick you, you should calculate the score you would get if you were to follow the strategy guide.\n\nFor example, suppose you were given the following strategy guide:\n\nA Y\nB X\nC Z\n\nThis strategy guide predicts and recommends the following:\n\nIn the first round, your opponent will choose Rock (A), and you should choose Paper (Y). This ends in a win for you with a score of 8 (2 because you chose Paper + 6 because you won).\nIn the second round, your opponent will choose Paper (B), and you should choose Rock (X). This ends in a loss for you with a score of 1 (1 + 0).\nThe third round is a draw with both players choosing Scissors, giving you a score of 3 + 3 = 6.\nIn this example, if you were to follow the strategy guide, you would get a total score of 15 (8 + 1 + 6).\n\nWhat would your total score be if everything goes exactly according to your strategy guide?"}]}, {"id": "HaVuc1Y_0", "conversations": [{"from": "human", "value": "Explain quantum computing in simple terms"}]}, {"id": "IiBEvLX_0", "conversations": [{"from": "human", "value": "You are a task reminder assistant.

I don't dispute/contest these software.\n\nBut,... what about Local Governments with limited budget? They can not afford this paid license software. To some, such software is a luxury or even overkill. They need to make decision, yet they need these crucial infrastructure to build policy.

Suppose they require something, they can post bounties.\n\n(an example of bounties in open-source software dev https://maplibre.org/news/2022-10-16-call-for-bounties/)\n\ncommunity involvement and inspection; as people might find vulnerabilities and can directly submit an issue through the Github issue page. More importantly, they can propose concretely how the issue should be fixed! (through Pull-Requests).\n\ntransparent as we know who does what for the software stack. The record can be seen through the Git Logs.\n\nFollowing open standard; the data schema is modular: following OSGEO and OGC standards. Switching between stack is easy as it is standardised. This is like USB ports, we have standardised USB-C now, every device can connect through the same charger. Imagine if every phone has their own USB port?\n\nall and all, happy to learn such practice for local government.

Changes to water resources can have a big impact on our world and our lives. Flooding is an increasing issue as our climate is changing. Compared to the beginning of the 20th century, there are both stronger and more frequent abnormally heavy precipitation events across the world. Conversely, drought is also becoming more common. Humans are using more water, especially for agriculture. Much like we sweat more when it is hot out, higher air temperatures cause plants to lose, or transpire, more water, meaning farmers must give them more water. Both highlight the need for more water in places where supplies are dwindling.\n\nClimate change is already impacting human health. Changes in weather and climate patterns can put lives at risk. Heat is one of the deadliest weather phenomena. As ocean temperatures rise, hurricanes are getting stronger and wetter, which can cause direct and indirect deaths. Dry conditions lead to more wildfires, which bring many health risks. Higher incidences of flooding can lead to the spread of waterborne diseases, injuries, and chemical hazards. As geographic ranges of mosquitoes and ticks expand, they can carry diseases to new locations. Farmers can suffer from heat-related health issues, like exhaustion, heatstroke, and heart attacks and this directly affects the food they put on our tables. Rising temperatures and heat stress can also harm livestock, which exacerbates the declining food situation.\n\nUsing your own words as far as possible, summarise the impacts of climate change based on the above.\n\nYour summary must be in continuous writing (not note form).

But I will be honest with you I was selling the dream but not always living the dream. I had issues I had not worked completely through like childhood trauma, heartbreak, disappointments, and frustrations with life. Don't get me wrong I had the husband, the kids, the house and the 6 figure job but I was not happy inside, but I didn't change because I hate change, most of us hate change, right? Then I lost my sister, my friend, and it slapped me in the face that I need to take care of myself. I saw the addiction, I saw her not taking care of herself and I could not save her. One thing I know for sure, if you do not make your wellness a priority illness will find you. I remember the moment we lost her, the earth stood still and then my heart broke into pieces, what was I going to do, I have loved her my whole life! It was months later that I made a decision that I would be the change I hope to see, I would create a space for women of color to move past the obstacles that keep us from creating the life we want and Brown Suga Wellness was born.

They were the most beautiful person she had ever known, with an otherworldly quality that was difficult to define, but undeniably captivating. When she started the job, Dr. Morningstar appeared aloof and detached, but as time passed, their relationship became warmer.\n\nLisa was always impressed by Dr. Morningstar's remarkable talent as a piano player, but their partner Morpheus was even more exceptional. When the two of them played a duet in the store, it was nothing short of spectacular.\n\nToday was just another regular workday. Lisa arrived early to prepare the store for opening and found that Dr. Morningstar and their partner were already there. Her boss was playing a solo on the piano while Morpheus watched them closely. Lisa couldn't help but notice the look of pure adoration on Morpheus' face, a small but unmistakable smile tugging at the corners of his lips. \n\nThe music that filled the air was one that had been sung for generations, and it had brought Lisa endless comfort during times of grief and struggle. She quietly sang the lyrics along with the melody, letting the familiar words and tune soothe her soul. As the music reached its peak, she felt the urge to sing out loud, but she didn't want to disturb the moment that felt like an eternity.\n\n\u201cWhen we've been here ten thousand years. \n\nBright, shining as the sun,\n\nWe've no less days to sing God's praise,\n\nThan when we first begun.\u201d\n\nAs Lisa lost herself in the music, she felt her eyes grow moist and tears began to fall. She didn't even realize when the song had come to an end.\n\nAfter she snapped out of her thoughts, Dr. Morningstar was already standing in front of her, their outstretched hand holding a key. \"I've finished the paperwork. The store is now yours. I bid you farewell,\" they said.\n\nLisa felt a jolt of electricity shoot through her veins. She had always dreamed of owning her own store, but she never expected it to happen like this. \n\n\u201cI will take good care of Lux.\u201d She took the key from Dr. Morningstar with a trembling hand. It was a dream that came true. \n\nLisa watched as the couple walked out of the door of the shop, hand in hand. In the blink of an eye, they disappeared into a brilliant light unlike anything she had ever seen before. It was as if the light wielded a power that could shatter the boundaries between life and death.\n\nAs the light faded away, Lisa noticed a white feather with a star-like glow lying on the ground. Somehow, long ago, she had known that this day would come. She picked up the weightless material. It felt like the end of an era but also the beginning of a new chapter in her life."}]}, {"id": "LViX1wM_0", "conversations": [{"from": "human", "value": "We are running an experiment in which you will pretend to be able to access the Internet.
