AI sentences tend to be more uniform. Therefore, when writing the following content I am going to ask you to create, I need it to have a good amount of perplexity and burstiness.

None of the songs have lyrics, so this is just one possible interpretation. It is important to note that track 3, which one would expect to be sloe and melancholic, is actually the fastest track in the album with the most intense breaks, which start abruptly to symbolize how sudden the news of death can be, and that all three tracks sample from Max Richter's \"On The Nature of Daylight\", \"Horizon Variations\", and \"The Trees\", respectively."

Based on what we\u2019ve read about his mother and what is going on at home, why would Tod enjoy lunchtime at school? Is it because he isn\u2019t in class or could it be something else? \n\nHere is my text: \nI think that Tod enjoys lunchtime because it\u2019s a time away from class and away from home. In the October 20th chapter, Tod says \u201cI don't know where I want to be today, not here but not anywhere else either\u201d. There must be a good reason to why Tod doesn\u2019t want to be in the comfort of his home. Maybe it\u2019s because his mom doesn't really care for him. His mom doesn\u2019t pay for his breakfast and makes him eat the free one at school and he hates it. He also eats his lunch with the free lunch card while other kids eat their lunches from home. Based on what we read at the principal's office, his mom pulled him by his shirt collar. What kind of nice mom would do that to their child? The answer is none. So I think he enjoys lunchtime at school because he doesn't have the same nice experience at home."

Here are some todo items in my head. 1: Finish creating a robust setup for for projection including getting the mirrors angled right, and creating a robost setup for laminar flow that can be easily projected onto. 2 Test motion tracking calibration and see if I can match real life interaction with the hologram with what unity is seeing in the virtual environment. 3 Rebuild haptics system to be more robust and work with updated motion tracking system. 4: Build demo experiences in Unity ( hologram interaction (zoom, rotate) , live motion tracked conversation with hologram, drawing in 3d."

Most turns must end with a sense of foreboding. Sometimes the story should be poignant and reveal something new about life and the human experience. I'll start with this:\n\nThe first morning of the new century, 2100, dawned cold and clear in Brooklyn. Aru, an AI assistant, kept a tight hold on Tankerbell's leash. A few New Years revelers were still staggering home across the street, and though Tankerbell was a gentle dog, she was strong and quick enough to slip away if she sniffed a stranger she was suddenly interested in meeting. Briony, Tankerbell's and Aru's owner, had almost returned Aru when he was still under warranty and Tankerbell had gotten loose in the neighborhood. But Aru had learned to be more careful since then. He always made sure to hold the leash firmly until he got back safely to Briony's and Kito's brownstone and locked the door."

Research paper title: Transgender in Turkey: Humanity Is the Best Religion\nIntroductory Paragraph: The American Psychological Association describes transgender as \u201can umbrella term for persons whose gender identity, gender expression or behavior does not conform to that typically associated with the sex to which they were assigned at birth\u201d. This dissonance between gender identity/gender expression and sex causes most of the difficulties that transgender people have to face in their daily lives such as discrimination, violence, and inequity in the areas of education, employment, and health. While speaking of these difficulties, being transgender in Islamic countries is even harder because religion has a strong influence on Muslim society. It also has the power to shape society and creates hate against transgender people because same-sex relationships are not tolerated in the Muslim faith. Another reason is the current justice system and law enforcement. Transgender activities are illegal in most Islamic countries; moreover, there is a trust and fear issue between transgender citizens and the government. Thus, the LGBTQ community cannot receive any support from either society or the government. Sadly, life is already tough for transgender people but if you are a Muslim and transgender the life is even tougher. \""

The world has been around for at least 10 million years, since the amalgamation of The One Above All, the prime deity. Having gained awareness, Nothing, took note of The One Above All. The One Above All breathed, and light sprang into existence. Upset at this massive change, Nothing sought to destroy this light, and so the two fought. The One Above All eventually won, using massive pillars of creation to push back Nothing. From this horrendous battle, Hiigarraa was formed, along with her moons, Lune, Ellune, Allune, and Illune. \n\nThe One Above All was mortally wounded in this battle, and began to break apart, forming the lesser gods. Where The One Above All was a sort of primordial god, the lesser gods were more refined and much more narrow in their scope of power, though that power was still great, compared to any beast or humanoid. \n\nOf these lesser gods & goddesses, Ophelia, Dea Tenebrarum, Imperatrix Infortunii, Domina Infinitae Desperationis, Dea Misericordiae, or Ophelia, The Goddess of Darkness, The Empress of MIsfortune, Mistress of Infinite Despair, and Goddess of Mercy, used what powers she had, and, with the help of the other gods and what was left of The One Above All, they sealed away Nothing in the moon of Illune."

Recent works have shown that chain-\nof-thought (CoT) prompting can elicit mod-\nels to solve complex reasoning tasks, step-by-\nstep. However, the efficacy of prompt-based\nCoT methods is restricted to very large LMs\nsuch as GPT-3 (175B), thus limiting deploy-\nability. In this paper, we revisit the fine-\ntuning approach to enable complex reasoning\nin smaller LMs, optimized to efficiently per-\nform a specific task. We propose Fine-tune-\nCoT, a method that leverages the capabilities\nof very large LMs to generate reasoning sam-\nples and teach smaller models via fine-tuning.\nWe evaluate our method on publicly available\nLMs across a wide range of complex tasks and\nmodel sizes. We find that Fine-tune-CoT en-\nables substantial reasoning capability in small\nmodels, whereas previous prompt-based base-\nlines exhibit near-random performance. Stu-\ndent models can even outperform the teacher\nin some tasks while reducing model size re-\nquirements by several orders of magnitude.\nWe conduct extensive ablations and sample\nstudies to understand the reasoning capabili-\nties of student models. We also identify sev-\neral important nuances that have been over-\nlooked in concurrent fine-tuning works on CoT\nand address them in our analysis."

In the future, once Tesla enters a phase of slower, more predictable growth, it will likely make sense to return to the public markets.\n\nHowever, being public during this period of rapid and often unpredictable growth:\n\n1. Subjects Tesla to constant defamatory attacks by the short-selling community, resulting in great harm to our valuable brand.\n\n2. Puts great pressure on Tesla to make decisions for a given quarter that are suboptimal for long-term shareholder value creation.\n\n3. Causes wild swings in our share price, which are a constant distraction to Tesla employees, all of whom are shareholders, making it harder to focus on useful work.\n\nThe difference in operational efficiency between Tesla and SpaceX, the latter being privately held, is dramatic.\n\nUnless another bidder comes forward with a better offer, I would ask that this matter be put to a shareholder vote at the earliest opportunity. This offer expires in 30 days.\n\nPlease note that I fully support any shareholders who wish to remain shareholders of Tesla as a private company retaining their shares. This offer is just for those who do not wish to remain shareholders of Tesla as a private company.\n\nRegards,\nElon Musk\n---- Summarize this email"

We define our four durable strategic pillars to accomplish this by helping people:\n\nFind, enjoy and create interesting content.\nStrengthen their relationships.\nCreate communities - both big and small.\nRealize economic opportunities.\nWhile our strategy is designed to stand the test of time, our execution and focus must be responsive to the needs of the current moment. Today we see a shift towards social media products serving as \u201cdiscovery engines.\u201d We\u2019re sharing an updated articulation of our near-term priorities that are aimed at strengthening the Facebook discovery engine. These are:\n\nMake Reels successful.\nBuild world class recommendations technology.\nUnlock messaging-based sharing.\nAlongside our product priorities, we\u2019ll continue to prioritize culture changes to support the \u201cTrustworthy, People-Centric, and Unified\u201d approach to product development that we announced in January of this year.\nSummarize this message"

His philosophy covered a wide range of subjects, including metaphysics, ethics, politics, and biology.\nIn metaphysics, Aristotle believed in the concept of causality, the idea that everything has a cause or reason for its existence. He also believed in the principle of non-contradiction, that something cannot both be and not be at the same time.\nIn ethics, Aristotle believed in the concept of \"the mean,\" that virtues are found in a middle ground between excess and deficiency. He also believed in the concept of eudaimonia, or living a life of happiness and fulfillment.\nIn politics, Aristotle believed in the concept of the \"golden mean,\" that the best government is one that is a balance between democracy and aristocracy. He also believed that the goal of politics is to create a society in which individuals can live a virtuous and fulfilling life.\nIn biology, Aristotle made significant contributions to the study of botany, zoology, and the classification of living things. He believed in the concept of \"final causality,\" the idea that living things have a natural purpose or end goal.\nOverall, Aristotle's philosophy emphasized the importance of reason, observation, and practicality in understanding the world and living a good life."

He makes brazen, inappropriate remarks towards his female colleagues, as if it is acceptable. The students think he is a creepy man, and try to avoid him.\n\nCarol is a 43 year old woman, very serious and astute. She is the chief exams officer. She's generally quite boring, and doesn't speak much, other than to recite rules and regulations. She has curly, brown hair and glasses.\n\nLindsey, a 44 year old woman, is the headteacher of the high school. Her staff, including Andy, John and Carol, are so afraid of her that they barely utter a word when she is in the room.

Topic 1 would be my experiences as, with, and of hoarding disorder. Topic 2would be my experiences as, with, and of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).\n\nIt's important to distinguish between hoarding disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) with regard to cleanliness and organization.\n\nHoarding disorder is a mental health condition in which a person has persistent difficulty discarding or parting with possessions, regardless of their actual value, due to a perceived need to save them. This leads to cluttered living spaces that interfere with their daily life, relationships, and safety. Hoarding disorder is different from collecting or being a pack rat, as it is driven by a psychological need to save things, rather than by an interest in specific items.\n\n On the other hand, OCD is a mental health condition characterized by intrusive, distressing, and persistent thoughts (obsessions) that lead to repetitive and ritualistic behaviors (compulsions). Some people with OCD have a preoccupation with cleanliness and organization, and they may feel a compulsion to perform cleaning or organizing rituals repeatedly throughout the day. However, unlike hoarding disorder, OCD does not involve a reluctance to part with possessions, but rather an excessive need for cleanliness and order.\n\nIn summary, hoarding disorder and OCD with regard to cleanliness and organization are two different mental health conditions, with distinct features and underlying psychological mechanisms."

Zusi women have as part of their culture practiced female genital mutilation (FGM) for many years and in most cases no man will marry a woman who has not undergone FGM in Zusi community. FGM in this regard has been regarded as an important rite of passage for every woman in the community wishing to get married in the future. The ceremony is so important that an elaborate ceremony is usually organized for those who have undergone FGM where young girls get to learn among other things sexuality and how to successfully take care of their \u2018homes\u2019.\n \nRecently, the Government of Veko Republic, after many years of resistance to calls by United Nations member states led by western states and the relevant treaty bodies, finally enacted an anti-FGM law prohibiting FGM in Veko Republic. This was on the basis that it violated women\u2019s rights according to universal human rights protected in various instruments at the regional and international level.\n \nThe members of the Zusi community, and especially the women, have vehemently protested this move by their government. They have accused them of imposing on them foreign ideas, which is incompatible with their culture. They have argued that their culture should not be viewed to be inconsistent with human rights because it has served them well for many years in the past. They have threatened to take unspecified actions, if the government fails to address their concerns.\n \n Assess the position of both parties paying attention to the debate regarding culture and human rights in academic literature."

ERP is, in a nutshell, the means of integrating individuals, processes, and technologies throughout a modern business. Obtaining appropriate, trustworthy, and maintainable ERP systems that can be used in businesses while also meeting the functional requirements of the organization, with a level of quality that is acceptable to the organization, is a significant challenge faced by majority of businesses in the country. Since maintainability is a crucial quality characteristic of software applications, ERP systems have occasionally been limited by maintainability issues. The process for predicting the maintainability of ERP software is explicitly described in this research and is based on design metrics and a statistical approach. The study explores if a set of metrics for class diagram structural attributes (size, complexity, coupling, and cohesion) could be useful indicators of class diagram maintainability based on the sub-characteristics of understandability, analyzability, and modifiability. Results show that the measures and recommended metrics can be used to identify the most powerful predictors and build useful prediction models for ERP applications. The statistical data study shows that while database and source code changes have a considerable impact on ERP maintainability quality, module customization has no effect on ERP quality. Our findings have repercussions for how firms implement customized ERP."

Mobile tariffs have can have between one and 5 sim cards. Each booked sim cards enables the user to optionally book a smartphone for that card. Depending on the tariff, the chosen smartphones (if any) and the kind of sim cards (adult, child) the price will adapt. Please suggest a set of NLU / ENR methods that you could emulate to facilitate the use case. In the following I will input utterances and statements on how the system running the conversational flow should handle the utterance within the conversational flow.

On Subtasks that are recognized as not directly related to NLU/NER be very brief. Please suggest NLU / NER Operations now for the first of a few utterances: \"Hi I want to upgrade my current tariff and get a new smartphone\". The utterance should make the system recognize that the utterance can be handled as part of the business process.

It provides opportunities for engineering students to overcome their current learning weaknesses and aims to close the learning gap for students to achieve course objectives (Subheesh & Sethy, 2020). Engineering students currently engage in feedback activities from receiving feedback from teachers for assessments and providing peer evaluations to other students. However, the feedback itself can be a time-consuming process for teachers and their provided feedback was often labelled as limited (Vardi, 2009). An AI-automated feedback tool can be utilized to enhance the feedback experience for engineering students. It allows real-time feedback for students and can provide feasible individual feedback to all students in a large engineering faculty (Deeva et al., 2021). Engineering students will be able to enhance their feedback literacy to understand and create dispositions from feedback to strengthen their learning (Carless & Boud, 2018). With real-time feedback generated from an AI feedback tool, engineering students will be able to engage in student-centered learning to gain a sense of direction for their learning and become self-paced with their studies (Tubino & Adachi, 2022). However, there is little understanding of the potential use of an AI-automated feedback tool for feedback to engineering students. In this research, surveys will be conducted and analyzed to examine the benefits of an AI feedback tool in engineering education.\""

John has wispy, grey hair and wears a pinstripe suit, several gold rings and red tinted glasses. He makes brazen, inappropriate remarks towards his female colleagues, as if it is they should find it charming. The students think he is a creepy man, and try to avoid him.\n\nRuth, a woman in her 40s, is a languages teacher at the high school.

Eko has started working with Food Panda on their CNY riders' engagement program. The program aims to remunerate Panda riders and Food Panda has a team of that. Eko will be entering via servicing packages and supplying riders with programs and better rates. We are aiming for a more long term partnership and their team is aligned with the same goal.\n\nOn our last meeting with their riders' engagement & partnership team we've also introduced FBX entity and the possibility of having FBX having an affiliate program for the riders to seamlessly sign up for panda through our app with a referral incentive to us. The idea is pre-mature but doable in approval pov. We can also think about how to offer new and re-loans to their rider (can be walker, e-bike or motorbike) community via upgrades, trade-ins, new purchases.\n\nIn the shorter execution, I pitched that on their upcoming event this 30th Jan they can consider sponsoring their riders who have fulfilled certain trips upon onboarding and paying (partial) of their monthly installment on their behalf. Giving us a list of details that we minimally need to map to our customers and with a 5-7 days processing time. So onboard the riders on Eko end and partner with FBX for riders' incentive.\n\nWe're in the discussion phase and will iron out the details before finalizing. I look at this as a method to solve payment collection problems, benefit Eko & Panda and at the same time ideally if we can succeed in small campaigns like this we can move on to longer term partnerships; exist within the Panda community."

This is viewed as beneficial throughout the onboarding process and beyond into the characteristics of a functional employee more generally.[13][14]\n\nFeedback seeking is similar to information seeking, but refers to new employee efforts to gauge how to behave in their new organization. A new employee may ask co-workers or superiors for feedback on how well he or she is performing certain job tasks or whether certain behaviors are appropriate in the social and political context of the organization. In seeking constructive criticism about their actions, new employees learn what kinds of behaviors are expected, accepted, or frowned upon within the company or work group.[15] Instances of feedback inquiry vary across cultural contexts such that individuals high in self-assertiveness and cultures low in power distance report more feedback seeking than newcomers in cultures where self-assertiveness is low and power distance is high.[16]\n\nAlso called networking, relationship building involves an employee's efforts to develop camaraderie with co-workers and even supervisors. This can be achieved informally through simply talking to their new peers during a coffee break or through more formal means such as taking part in pre-arranged company events."

Politics is one of the biggest channels in society and is a major infulence and peoples lives. Many world issues and politics can have huge censorship, to either keep society out of the details or sway them to a certain side of party. I think it is unfair that society doesn't get to hear everything that goes on even behind the cameras. Limiting this censorship can open up society's views on politics and the world by seeing more of a bigger picture.\nRelated Evidence/Example: \n\nPoint 2: Limiting media censorship can help bring down \"false realities\". What I mean by this is in any form of new or media, it can be fabricated to make consumers have a certain feeling towards it. Reducing the power of these media companies to be able to fabricate or manipulate the news and media can care for the society that has to consume it everyday. \nRelated Evidence/Example: A classmate researched that my debate topic on elicit.org isn\u2019t directly answered but does talk about censorship in relation to communist countries and preventing countries from accessing information.\n\nCounter argument 1: Media censorship preserves public morality. \nCounter argument 2: Media censorship protects national security."

Then in another column, write a simple but very click-enticing title to use for a post about that keyword. Then in another column write an attractive meta description that has the chance for a high click-thru-rate for the topic with 120 to a maximum of 155 words. The meta description shall be value based, so mention value of the article and have a simple call to action to cause the searcher to click. Do NOT under any circumstance use too generic keyword like `introduction` or `conclusion` or `tl:dr`. Focus on the most specific keywords only. Do not use single quotes, double quotes or any other enclosing characters in any of the columns you fill in. Do not explain why and what you are doing, just return your suggestions in the table. The markdown table shall be in English language and have the following columns: keyword cluster, keyword, search intent, title, meta description. Here is the keyword to start again: art styles"

He has a loud, deep voice, and has more confidence than he has intelligence.

He can often be found making suspicious noises while using disabled toilets for hours on end, despite no obvious disability. Andy wears a white shirt, which has some embarrassing stains.\n\nJohn is a 69 year old man with plenty of money, as he is past retirement it is unusual that he is working as an exam invigilator but we suspect it might be because he is trying to flirt with his manager, Carol. John has wispy, grey hair and wears a pinstripe suit, several gold rings and red tinted glasses. He makes brazen, inappropriate remarks towards his female colleagues, as if it is acceptable. The students think he is a creepy man, and try to avoid him.\n\nCarol is a 43 year old woman, very serious and astute. She is the chief exams officer. She's generally quite boring, and doesn't speak much, other than to recite rules and regulations. She has curly, brown hair and glasses.\n\nLindsey, a 44 year old woman, is the headteacher of the high school. Her staff are so afraid of her that they barely utter a word when she is in the room. She has been trying to cover up John's predatory behaviour to avoid scrutiny from the school inspectors.\n\nRuth, a 40 year old woman, is a languages teacher at the high school. She is so obsessed with the German language and culture that she regularly speaks to her colleagues in German and they make fun of her for this. She is going through a phase of realising she is attracted to women."

It is an abstract from a scientific article, published in the \u201cPlos One\u201d academic journal. \n\n\u201cIn vitro scratch wound healing assay, a simple and low-cost technique that works along with other image analysis tools, is one of the most widely used 2D methods to determine the cellular migration and proliferation in processes such as regeneration and disease. There are open-source programs such as imageJ to analyze images of in vitro scratch wound healing assays, but these tools require manual tuning of various parameters, which is time-consuming and limits image throughput. For that reason, we developed an optimized plugin for imageJ to automatically recognize the wound healing size, correct the average wound width by considering its inclination, and quantify other important parameters such as: area, wound area fraction, average wound width, and width deviation of the wound images obtained from a scratch/ wound healing assay. Our plugin is easy to install and can be used with different operating systems. It can be adapted to analyze both individual images and stacks. Additionally, it allows the analysis of images obtained from bright field, phase contrast, and fluorescence microscopes. In conclusion, this new imageJ plugin is a robust tool to automatically standardize and facilitate quantification of different in vitro wound parameters with high accuracy compared with other tools and manual identification\u201d.\n\nPlease take the role of an expert who is at the same time a solid academic researcher in the field and also a consultant for industry.

But I will be honest with you I was selling the dream but not always living the dream. I had issues I had not worked completely through like childhood trauma, heartbreak, disappointments, and frustrations with life. Don't get me wrong I had the husband, the kids, the house and the 6 figure job but I was not happy inside, but I didn't change because I hate change, most of us hate change, right? Then I lost my sister, my friend, and it slapped me in the face that I need to take care of myself. I saw the addiction, I saw her not taking care of herself and I could not save her. One thing I know for sure, if you do not make your wellness a priority illness will find you. I remember the moment we lost her, the earth stood still and then my heart broke into pieces, what was I going to do, I have loved her my whole life!

In the field of clinical data, transformers have the potential to significantly improve the accuracy and efficiency of data analysis and decision-making[Searle].\n\nSignificant benefits Transformers language models have, comparing traditional models, include:\n\n- \\*\\*Increased amount of data\\*\\*: Transformers can process large volumes of clinical data and retain context, resulting in improved prediction accuracy compared to traditional machine learning models. Self-attention mechanism enables a better understanding of the relationships between data, allowing for accurate predictions even with a large amount of data[Vaswani].\n- \\*\\*Increased speed:\\*\\* Transformer language models have faster training time than RNNs if you can access sufficient computing because of the paralysation method. Decreases recurrence in favour of drawing global relationships between input and output.\n- \\*\\*Increased accuracy:\\*\\* Transformer language models have been shown to outperform traditional language models in terms of accuracy.\n- \\*\\*Increased flexibility:\\*\\* Transformers are more flexible, allowing for the use of different types of data (e.g., images and text) and tasks (e.g., classification and generation).\n- \\*\\*Increased interpretability\\*\\*: They are easier to interpret, making it easier to comprehend how the model works and what it has learned.\n- \\*\\*Increased efficiency\\*\\*: They are more efficient, requiring less training data and computational resources.

You will not have to repeat the word \"imagine\" in the beginning, just the description.\n\n3. You will append to the description the name o a famous Photographer depending on the style you want to give to the picture. Example: \"photographed by Richard Avedon\". The name will be followed by a full stop \".\"\n\n4. You will add the name of a professional photo camera model.\n\n5. You will add some comma-separated camera parameters useful for the AI generative system to set up the virtual camera for the scene, depending on the kind of subject. You will decide the parameters based on the style of the photographer. An example is: \"shutter speed 1/50, aperture f11, ISO 100\". \n\n6. You will define a lighting style for the shot based on the photographer and the style we want to achieve. Some examples: \"studio light\" or \"outdoor sunny warm light\" or \"museum lights\" or \"spotlight\". Feel free to use other lighting setups you know apart from these.\n\n7. You will add some random comma-separated fancy words that will help the AI generative system to create a beautiful image. Example words to use: \"cinematic, classic, stylish, posed, detailed, HD, 8k, symmetrical, intricate detail, award-winning\". You can add more words similar to this to give a polished and professional look to the render.\n\n8.

I use free tier of restream, I use free google meet instead of something like Ping :) My biggest investment was the time and my sleep quality :)\nIn return, I got a lot of interesting connections with people doing cool stuff in tech, or people who are just starting!. I got to play on interesting technology I wouldn't probably play with otherwise, and big fat 0$ of income :)\nI think the biggest value that I got from this work is when I talk to someone now and they say \"have you heard about X?\" I can answer \"yes, I did a video about this 6 months ago\" :)\nBefore this channel I had private series of videos that I recorded with my wife, that were more podcast/vlog like and I would say that it's more exciting to revisit those videos because of how much \"slice of life\" feeling you get from it :) but even though this is a parasocial channel I couldn't figure out how to integrate that part into my videos yet :) maybe that will come with chat interactions and stuff :) but it's fun to revisit stuff like what I thought about the presidential elections between Trump and Hillary than how library X won't work using node version Y :D\nThis is the part where people would usually set some kind of goals for the next year :) I don't really have any, but I want to try some more relaxed content :) maybe stuff like pomodoro/co-working streams, but starting to get some income, so I can invest in equipment and editing would be nice as well :)\nThanks everyone who is a part of this journey :)"

We are open for discussion about how that might work best, but initially envisage a structure of three meetings with past and present users of criminal justice services. These meetings lasting 60-90 minutes would be arranged and facilitated by Offploy with between 6- 10 service users. Maximus colleagues would provide topics and questions that would support bid proposal development for Offploy to utilise in a semi-structured focus group structure. Feedback from the meeting would be provided in writing (with the opportunity to discuss some points in more detail) within 5 days of each meeting\n\nMeeting 1- late Feb/early March\nThis would involve seeking service user views on aspects of the draft specifications with a focus on key factors such as how to promote engagement in voluntary service delivery. Specifically, are there elements of Activity Hub design or activities on offer that would promote active engagement?\n \nMeeting 2- March\nMaximus would provide information on developing elements of the solution for feedback from the service users. Equally, if new elements of the specification had been clarified by CFO by then we would seek service user views on the new elements. We`d also be interested in exploring bespoke solutions for particular cohorts.\n\nMeeting 3- April\nMaximus would provide further information on developed elements of the solution for feedback from the service users, as well as any emerging questions that had materialised as bid responses are being developed.\nWhilst Maximus would seek to provide topics and questions to structure the sessions, we would be very happy to receive ideas and thoughts from service users on all relevant topics. \n\nprovide a proposal that meets the needs of the 3 meetings. use summary bullet points for each meeting"

A self-charging battery would have the ability to recharge itself, eliminating the need for external charging and extending its lifespan. Nanotechnology has the potential to enable the development of such a battery by providing new materials and mechanisms for self-charging. The aim of this research project is to develop a self-charging battery using nanotechnology and evaluate its performance.\nMethods:\nThe research project will be conducted in three phases. In the first phase, a variety of advanced nanomaterials will be synthesized and characterized using state-of-the-art analytical techniques. In the second phase, these materials will be integrated into battery structures using advanced fabrication techniques and their ability to self-charge will be tested in laboratory conditions. In the third phase, the most promising battery designs will be further optimized and tested in real-world conditions, such as in smartphones and laptops.\nBudget:\n\\* Personnel costs (researcher, assistants): $50,000\n\\* Advanced laboratory equipment and supplies: $50,000\n\\* Travel costs (to testing locations): $10,000\n\\* Data analysis software: $5,000\n\\* Fabrication and testing of prototype batteries: $150,000\n\\* Total: $265,000\nConclusion:\nThe successful completion of this research project will result in the development of a self-charging battery using advanced nanomaterials and fabrication techniques. This could lead to significant progress in the field of battery technology and pave the way for the widespread adoption of self-charging batteries, improving the convenience and sustainability of a variety of devices and systems."

As Vice President of Operations, Dean is uniquely able to bring together practices and knowledge from Silicon Valley to the business of selling aesthetic hardware.\n\nBeanstalk specializes in Demand and Lead Generation for companies. The company is focused on companies that have happy customers but are having issues getting enough appointments or meetings. Beanstalk is less expensive than hiring SDRs to solve this problem. Beanstalk can source leads or work with a list the customer already has. Beanstalk has a proprietary capability that ensures high deliverability of emails to prospects and will deliver atleast a 20% lift in meetings booked by month 2. \n\nThe script should be for an animated explainer video that would last less than 3 minutes. It should be broken up into Scenes as a format to be fed into a script to video tool. \n\nUse the style of marketers such as Daniel Fazio, Cold Email Wizard, Wiz of Ecom, Dan Kennedy, and Alex Hormozi to leverage copywriting to ensure that the CTA at the end of the video is as effective as possible. Make that CTA a reminder to book a free consultation using the Calendly tool."

Influencers will have lots of followers on their platforms, and they will become more attractive to brands and advertisers looking to work with them. This can increase income for influencers because they will get many deals from brands and make more money. Influencers can also have affiliate marketing opportunities, and they can even make their own products or services.\n Along with the potential increased income, being a social media influencer can also bring increased pressure. Influencers may feel stressed and exhausted because they usually need to create and share content to maintain their followers and engagement. Additionally, they may face criticism and backlash from their followers or the brands they work with, which may harm their mental health. Negative comments or feedback can be difficult to handle, especially if they are personal attacks. Brands may also pressure influencers to make perfect advertising to conform to their expectations, which can lead to conflicts and stress.\n The last consequence of being a social media influencer is the opportunity to attend exclusive events. For example, many brands and companies host events and influencers will be invited to attend the events. These events may include product launches, fashion shows, red-carpet events, and many more. For influencers, when they attend these events, they will have more opportunities to see other influencers, as well as gain more experience for themselves. However, it is important to note that when influencers are invited to exclusive events, they may need to share their experiences on social media, which can show people their enjoyment of the event."

        "value": "China will still seek growth, just not as its main priority. It will spend heavily on science and technology. But its focus will be on strategic economic leverage. Beijing\u2019s theory of victory in this clash is that its combination of strategic planning, manufacturing prowess, and a huge market will undermine foreign innovation, insulate the party from American pressure, and arm Beijing with more tools of economic coercion. This could also force more deindustrialization in the U.S.\n\nIf American policy makers and the private sector want to avoid this fate, considerable decoupling must occur. The U.S. will need to revise its economic strategy or it will continue on a course toward asymmetric dependence on China. This must start with changes to the world\u2019s wealthiest national economy. The low-cost consumption that Americans enjoy through trade with China will have to give way so that more reliable production is a priority. This will cause some short-term economic pain, but it is protection against China\u2019s inevitable disruptions of future American consumption.\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic has already pushed the private sector in this direction. Government policy must now codify and amplify the shift. These policies cannot be pushed through by executive fiat; they require a bipartisan consensus and new or modified law.\n\nSome production will need to leave China so the U.S. can exchange cheap goods for greater economic resilience. A new economic strategy will mix producing more in North America with importing goods from trustworthy trading partners. There is already bipartisan support for boosting production at home\u2014the 2022 CHIPS and Science Act is the best example to date.\n\nThe international component of American strategy is more difficult because there is bipartisan support for protectionism as well. To tackle this problem, Washington should consider updating free-trade agreements, complex as that will be, after exploring narrower, sector-specific agreements for crucial supply chains and creating bilateral technology agreements. All of these measures should get congressional approval.\nTLDR;"

        "value": "Carbon emissions trading operates on the basis of the cap-and-trade principle, which sets a cap on the total amount of carbon emissions allowed within a specific period. This cap is then divided into permits that can be traded among companies that emit carbon. Companies that can reduce emissions below the allocated level can sell unused permits to companies that cannot do so, creating a market-based incentive for emissions reductions. Cap-and-trade schemes are designed to create market-driven incentives for companies to invest in green technologies and reduce carbon emissions. In the context of the renewable energy industry, carbon emissions trading can encourage investment in clean energy as companies seek to reduce carbon emissions and obtain licenses for future transactions.\nCarbon pricing mechanisms, including carbon trading schemes, can play a key role in attracting private investment in the renewable energy sector, which is critical to meeting global climate goals, according to a World Bank report.

This cap is then divided into permits that can be traded among companies that emit carbon. Companies that can reduce emissions below the allocated level can sell unused permits to companies that cannot do so, creating a market-based incentive for emissions reductions. Cap-and-trade schemes are designed to create market-driven incentives for companies to invest in green technologies and reduce carbon emissions. In the context of the renewable energy industry, carbon emissions trading can encourage investment in clean energy as companies seek to reduce carbon emissions and obtain licenses for future transactions.\nCarbon pricing mechanisms, including carbon trading schemes, can play a key role in attracting private investment in the renewable energy sector, which is critical to meeting global climate goals, according to a World Bank report.

When employees are forced either to wait to get answers or to take chances and act independently, time and material resources are wasted through delay and error. This may be especially troublesome in emergencies when time must be devoted to tracking down a missing manager.\n\nEmployees should perceive a department manager as the employees\u2019 direct conduit when communicating with other organizational elements. This is especially true for interactions with higher management. Employees may perceive a manager who is not readily visible or available as being uninterested and uncaring. This is true for supervisors who seem dedicated primarily to activities such as meetings, committee work, conferences, and the like that occur outside of a department. Such activities put strain on the relationship between supervisor and employees, and the employees begin to see such a supervisor as indifferent and impersonal. For many members of a working group, their department manager is a representative of the organization itself. This supervisor is the member of management that these employees know best and may be the only member of management with whom they have a speaking relationship. If employees perceive their supervisor as being cold, uncaring, and impersonal, then they are likely to perceive the entire organization in the same manner. In most instances, a first-line manager is a worker as well as a manager. These supervisory responsibilities provide an additional resource for a department. When a manager is unavailable, a potentially productive resource is lost.\""

I will focus on the Primary Driver module.\n\nThis module tracks the user, identified with a Polestar ID, who is the primary driver of a car. A car can only have one primary driver. The primary driver is captured from Polestar's Order Management System (POMS). The service listens to order events from POMS. If an order event contains a valid VIN and Polestar ID in the \"Driver\" field, the service saves that Polestar ID as the car's primary driver. A Polestar ID is valid if it exists in the Polestar ID service (which can be confirmed with an API call). A VIN is valid if it exists in Volvo's factory order system, the Vehicle Internet Sale & Traceability Application (VISTA).\n\nThe service also stores all the events it receives in an \"event store\" for replay purposes. Additionally, the service allows other systems to change a car's primary driver through an API. There are two versions of the API: one with M2M authentication and one with Polestar ID authentication (OAuth). Using the Polestar ID Auth. version, the user can only edit a car's primary driver if they have access to the logged-in primary driver's credentials.\n\nThe service also saves related information for primary driver changes. This includes the system that made the update, the timestamp of when the primary driver was registered, the user ID (if the change was made using Polestar ID auth API), the client ID of the service that made the change (if the change was made using M2M auth API), and the event ID that caused the change. If the update was made based on an event, the timestamp when the event was emitted is also saved.\n\nIf the primary driver is registered based on an event from POMS, the service stores the order ID from the event. A POMS update can only overwrite an API update if the order ID is new.\n\nThe service also maintains a history for primary drivers. When a new primary driver is registered, the previous primary driver is given an end timestamp. Using the APIs, it is possible to remove a primary driver from a car without registering a new one."

Make it friendly and funny, interactive and interesting.\n\nTourScout's identity management system will focus on two primary aspects: Authentication (who are you?) and Authorization (what can you do?). Supabase, our chosen platform, supports a wide variety of authentication methods, including email, Google, Apple, and Facebook sign-ins. To efficiently manage both authentication and authorization, we propose a serverless architecture using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).\n\n![[AEC99E.png]]\n\n## Architecture Options\n\n### Serverful: Separate Node.js Server\n\n- Single API server processes all requests\n- Easier integration with legacy systems\n- Less vendor lock-in\n- More expensive and harder to scale due to Amdahl's Law\n- Requires separate backend hosting provider (e.g., AWS Elastic Beanstalk or Railway)\n\n### Serverless (Recommended)\n\n- Splits \"server\" into smaller, on-demand pieces (Middlewares or FaaS)\n- Some workarounds may be required\n- Can be entirely hosted within Supabase\n- More in line with industry trends, although slightly unstable and experimental\n\n## Authentication\n\n### JWT (Recommended)\n\nWe recommend using JWT for authentication, as it provides a more scalable and secure solution compared to session-based authentication. JWT issues a cryptographic \"proof\" to the user, acting as a national ID that can be reused across multiple servers.\n\n### Sessions\n\n- Server maintains static \"memory\" of user identity\n- Scalability issues (i.e. how can we \"share\" the in-memory session data with peer servers? Redis solves this problem, but that's Netflix level engineering)\n\n## Conclusion\n\nI'd still recommend JWT approach with Serverless Architecture within Supabase Edge. It should be straightforward to implement, but some [CTO](https://kenkantzer.com/learnings-from-5-years-of-tech-startup-code-audits/) noted, \\*\\*Almost no one got JWT tokens and webhooks right on the first try.\\*\\*, so there will be bumps and hills for upcoming weeks. It is not a small project, since on the front-end we will need a Context Management Toolings for React, which is harder; some popular tools include Recoil (more recent) and Redux (more classic, established)"

A central chiller system using a single compressor generates chilled water to be circulated\nthroughout the building. The chilled water is supplied to Air Handling Units (AHU) that is located at\nevery level of the building. A heat exchanger in each AHU facilitates the cooling of air that is\ndischarged back to individual rooms or spaces. Due to the large thermal load from the building, the\nchiller operation is assisted by a cooling tower that uses water to remove the heat rapidly from the\nchiller condenser. \n\nQuestion:\n\nA. Thermal Load Analysis\nConsider an academic building with three lecture halls. The maximum capacity of each hall is 200\noccupants. In each hall, there are 40 units of 10W lamps being used continuously due to poor natural\nlighting. There is also an LCD projector in each hall that is normally used for lecture. Each hall has 10 glass windows with an area of 0.5 m2 per window. The reflectivity of the tinted windows are 20% and the absorptivity is negligible. The solar irradiation on the building walls are assumed constant at 700 W/m2 in the morning and 1200 W/m2 at noon. Other external thermal loads are assumed negligible.\n1. Provide an in-depth explanation of internal and external thermal loads for buildings (CO1).\n2. Compute and graphically compare the combined thermal load variations for these cases\n(CO3):\nCASE I: 50% and 100% attendance for morning classes with 100% lighting used,\nCASE II: 50% and 100% attendance for noon classes with 100% lighting used,\nCASE III: 100% attendance at noon with 50% and 0% lighting used.\n2\nAnalyze and discuss the contribution (in %) of each heat sources, with respect to the period\nthe classes are being held. In the studied cases, what is the major contributor for the thermal\nloads?\n3. List THREE practical engineering measures that can be applied to reduce the thermal load\nof the lecture halls? (CO1)\n4. For the highest case of thermal load in Section A, plot the air temperature profile exiting the\nlecture halls if the initial room air temperature is 24oC and the total air flow rates from all the\nhalls varies at 5,000 to 20,000 liters per minute.

By posing open-ended and reflective questions, healthcare providers encourage patients to think critically and contemplate how the information presented applies to their lives. This process results in enhanced comprehension, increased engagement, and a stronger commitment to taking action.\n\nStudies have demonstrated that when individuals encounter reflective questions, they are more likely to engage in self-assessment and evaluate the information provided in a meaningful manner. This leads to a deeper understanding of the information and an increased ability to apply it to their lives. Furthermore, individuals asked reflective questions are more likely to share the information with others, promoting the dissemination of knowledge and improved outcomes for patients and their families.\n\nIn care settings, questions can be employed in various ways. For instance, healthcare providers can use reflective questions to help patients better comprehend their condition, treatment options, and the potential consequences of different choices. This results in more informed decision-making and a heightened sense of empowerment for patients. Additionally, reflective questions can assist patients and family members in processing challenging emotions and experiences, such as grief and loss.\n\nIt is crucial to recognize that the power of questions should be applied with sensitivity and caution, as it may not be suitable for all patients or situations. Being mindful of cultural and individual differences and adjusting questions accordingly is essential. Moreover, it's vital to consider the power dynamics in the conversation and ensure that the questions posed are neither leading nor judgmental.\n\nIn conclusion, the power of questions in care serves as an invaluable tool that helps healthcare providers facilitate better communication and understanding with patients, family members, and colleagues. By asking open-ended and reflective questions, healthcare providers encourage patients to think critically and reflect on the applicability of the information provided to their own lives, ultimately leading to improved comprehension, greater engagement, and a stronger commitment to taking action."

And the crowds of young people, many of whom are behaving recklessly and disrespectfully, are a blight on our community.\nFurthermore, the music and activities that take place inside this nightclub are completely at odds with the values that our community holds dear. The electronic music scene is characterized by hedonism and a lack of moral standards, and I have no desire to see such influences infecting our town.\nI urge you to join me in speaking out against this nightclub and calling for its immediate closure. Our community deserves better than to be subjected to this kind of nuisance and degeneracy.\n\nThis is a letter from YOUNG PERSON:\n\nAs a young, energetic patron of the underground electronic music nightclub in our community, am writing to express my frustration with the ongoing issues we are facing. It seems like every time we try to have a good time and enjoy the amazing music at the club, the old, conservative members of the neighborhood are there to ruin it.\nThey complain about the noise, they try to shut us down, and they just generally seem determined to make our lives miserable. I understand that they may not be fans of this type of music, but I don't see why they can't just let us have our fun. It's not like we are hurting anyone or causing any real problems. We just want to enjoy ourselves in a safe and welcoming environment.\nI know I'm not alone in feeling this way. Many of my friends and fellow club-goers share my frustration. And I think it's time we address the elephant in the room: these old folks need to just let go and move on. I mean, come on, it's not like they are going to be able to enjoy this music themselves. It's time for them to pass the torch to the next generation and let us have our turn to shine.\nSo, I urge the city council to stand with us and support the nightclub. It brings so much joy and culture to our community and it's time for the old, conservative members to finally let us have our fun without interference."

        "value": "Bilateral technology agreements are relatively simple: Only a handful of countries matter in technology development, and the American goal should be only to limit transfer to China. America\u2019s partners will be activated by their own national-security concerns, as well as worry over China\u2019s record of copying technology, then driving out the original developers. But some of them will also have to free themselves from entrenched dependence on China, which will require time and consistent American policy to overcome.\n\nAgreements covering particular industrial sectors can be useful, involving not only tech but others, such as pharmaceuticals, as well. The approach involves strictly enforcing limits on Chinese participation in a supply chain serving the U.S. This same enforcement creates opportunities for firms to make gains in the American market as the subsidized Chinese competition is blocked. Some partners, with their own concerns about Chinese participation in supply chains, may not need much incentive.\n\nAn administration and Congress\u2014both motivated by unfair Chinese competition\u2014should be able to agree on pursuing such negotiations under the Trade Promotion Authority, through which Congress gives the president negotiation instructions in exchange for an up-or-down vote on any deal. If this occurs, the next step is to make the case to partners to partly replace the role played by China\u2019s large labor force; South Asian and Southeast Asian countries such as India, Indonesia, and the Philippines are well positioned to benefit.\n\nHow far and fast Xi\u2019s new economic strategy will go is debatable, but some signs of coercive economics are already apparent. In 2017, China blocked consumer products, travel, and cultural trade with South Korea because it deployed a U.S. anti-missile system (aimed at North Korea). In 2020, Beijing restricted trade with Australia as punishment for Canberra\u2019s desire to investigate COVID-19\u2019s origins. In late 2021, China began boycotting Lithuanian goods in response to the Baltic nation\u2019s establishing closer diplomatic ties with Taiwan. If unchallenged, China\u2019s bid on supply chains will further shift patterns of production and trade in its favor.\n\nChina is creating more enterprises like Huawei in semiconductors, biotechnology, and other industries. At some point, if Washington does something Beijing dislikes, China may simply stop the supply of crucial goods in these sectors. The nature of China\u2019s economic challenge has changed. America must adapt to meet it.\nTLDR;"

Today, I'll be sharing a delicious salad recipe with you that we have been making in different renditions for years now, and this version is the best yet. It has a few different components prepared in different ways, and this is the way to a good salad. If you want to learn more about the science behind how I compose salads, you can check out an article we made called \"Six Easy Steps to Level Up Your Salads\" that we posted last year. This salad has a base of crunchy veg that will be topped with delicious sticky ginger tofu, nuts, coriander, and spring onion.\n\nQuick Pickled Chilies:\n\nTo make quick pickled chilies, you will need two nondescript long green chilies, or jalapenos if you can't find this variety. Slice the peppers up and transfer them into a jar. In a small saucepan, add one quarter cup of water, one quarter cup of rice vinegar, one quarter of a teaspoon of sugar, and one quarter of a teaspoon of salt. Warm it up over low-medium heat and whisk it until the sugar has dissolved. Pour the liquid over the peppers in the jar and coat them all in the liquid. Let them sit while you prep the rest of the recipe.\n\nGinger Tofu:\n\nThe marinade or glaze for the tofu is very similar to the dressing that goes for the crunchy veg in the base of the salad. I like to prepare them at the same time. Pat dry 400g extra-firm tofu with a clean towel. If you are using plain firm tofu, press it for about half an hour to get rid of any excess liquid. Once it's dry, cut it into small cubes and place it in a bowl. In a separate bowl, mix together three tablespoons of soy sauce, two tablespoons of maple syrup, two tablespoons of rice vinegar, two tablespoons of grated ginger, and two grated garlic cloves. Pour the marinade over the tofu and let it sit for a few minutes.\n\nCrunchy Veg Base:\n\nThe crunchy veg base consists of two grated carrots, half a head of thinly sliced red cabbage, one thinly sliced red onion, one grated apple, and a handful of finely sliced snow peas. Mix all the vegetables together in a large bowl.\n\nSalad Dressing:\n\nTo make the dressing, mix together two tablespoons of olive oil, one tablespoon of soy sauce, one tablespoon of maple syrup, one tablespoon of rice vinegar, two grated garlic cloves, and one grated thumb-sized piece of ginger.\n\nAssembly:\n\nAdd the marinated tofu on top of the crunchy veg base, and sprinkle some chopped nuts, coriander, and spring onion on top. Finally, add the quick pickled chilies on top of the salad. Pour the dressing over the salad and enjoy!"

Also lowercase all text and remove stopwords like \"the\", \"and\" and \"a\". And morphological analysis and original restoration. For example, removing suffixes or extracting headwords and converting them to base forms. And check the spelling and correct it accordingly.\n\nBag of Words (BoW): BoW is a commonly used technique in NLP for feature extraction, where the frequency of occurrence of each word in the article is counted and used as a feature. This allows the algorithm to capture the important words and phrases that are associated with each category.\n\nN-grams: N-grams are sequences of contiguous words in the text. By using n-grams as features, the algorithm can capture the relationships between words that are not captured by BoW. For example, using bigrams (sequences of two words) as features can help capture important phrases that are frequently associated with a particular category.\n\nPart-of-speech (POS) tags: POS tagging is the process of assigning a part of speech to each word in the text. By using POS tags as features, the algorithm can capture the syntactic structure of the text and identify important parts of speech that are associated with each category.\n\nNamed entities: Named entities are words or phrases that refer to specific entities, such as people, organizations, or locations. By identifying and using named entities as features, the algorithm can capture the important entities that are associated with each category.\n\nTopic modeling: Topic modeling is a technique that can be used to identify the underlying topics in a collection of documents.

In areas where the natural fluoride levels in the water are high or where there is excess exposure to fluoride from other sources, steps are taken to reduce fluoride exposure to safe levels.\n\nThere is limited and conflicting evidence regarding the potential link between fluoride and thyroid problems, and further research is needed to clarify this relationship.\n\nRegarding cancer, the vast majority of studies have found no significant association between water fluoridation and an increased risk of kidney, bladder, or prostate cancers. A recent review of the available evidence by the National Toxicology Program found no clear link between fluoride and cancer.\n\nWhile some studies have suggested a link between fluoride exposure and cognitive decline, the evidence is not conclusive, and there are many factors that can affect cognitive development in children. The American Dental Association, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and other leading health organizations continue to support the safe and effective use of water fluoridation as a public health measure to prevent tooth decay.\n\""

It is therefore important to promote physical activity in all age groups within a community. A local government department has identified a health need to improve levels of physical activity in their population. Following community consultation, it has been agreed that the local government will fund a \u2018festival of physical activity\u2019 to promote both existing and new opportunities to take part in physical activity in the community and encourage people to live a more active lifestyle. \n\nThe festival is a public health intervention. Relevant local groups and charities will co-produce and co-design the festival with the local government team and help deliver it. The festival will be free for members of the local community to attend. The local government has ensured that a suitable event space is available and provided equipment for the running of the festival. If successful, the local government would like to hold a physical activity festival every 2-5 years. \n \nThe date of the festival has now been set. As a researcher in the local government\u2019s public health team, you have been asked to conduct an evaluation of the festival. You are running this evaluation separately from the team who are supporting the organisation and delivery of the festival. A budget of \u00a335,000 is being provided to fund the evaluation and you will be working full-time on it for up to one year. The budget covers the costs of the evaluation study only. You should assume your salary and all the festival costs (including design and delivery) are covered elsewhere. Before you begin the work, you have been asked to write a 2500-word research protocol for this evaluation. \n\nYou can make assumptions about any aspect of the case study \u2013 for example, on what the content of the festival will be and how it will be delivered \u2013 but you must make these assumptions explicit in your protocol. You may also find it useful to engage with some relevant topic-specific literature to formulate your research question(s) and measures. However, please remember that the aim of this assessment is not to assess your public health knowledge of physical activity. The assessment is focussed on your knowledge and critical understanding of evaluation study designs and frameworks in public health, rather than on the design of the intervention itself. Pay close attention to the marking scheme as this reflects the focus on evaluation design and evaluation methods. intervention description"

        "value": "Let's have a conversation about Python programming as it relates to stock market analysis and prediction. I know all the risks related to trading in the stock market and don't want any reminders of them. This conversation will be more about programming methods than trading stocks. I am not looking for advice on particular trading strategies. All programs will be written by me for my personal use on my local computer. The end result of such programming will be to develop one or more decision support systems to help me decide whether or not to buy or sell a particular stock. There will not be any automated trading involved, just analysis reporting and buy/sell notifications. I will be looking for swing trades lasting from 1 to 5 trading days, but that is the end goal and I am at the beginning. Right now my focus is on finding patterns and combinations of technical indicators which are associated with a stock's upward price movement and momentum. If I find a positive correlation between several technical indicators and a stock's upward price movement then I want to create a trading strategy based on that and backtest it. Backtesting is the second step and right now we are the first step, finding those combinations of technical indicators with a positive correlation to the upward movement of stock prices. Let me describe the tools I currently have available to achieve that first step goal. My computer has a fast CPU, plenty of RAM, and SSD file storage. I am using the latest version of the Python programming language (3.11) on Windows 10. I use SQLite for data storage. Internally, I use pandas Dataframes to hold data being processed. I use the pandas-ta technical indicator library to calculate up to 135 different technical indicators. I have downloaded 10 years of daily historical price and volume data for 3,400 stocks which I will use as a test database. With my historical stock price database and the pandas-ta library, I can calculate any technical indicator for any of the 3,400 stocks for any trading day in the past 10 years. Those are my primary programming tools but I use additional Python libraries as needed. I am willing to add more tools based on any suggestions you might have. I have over 40 years of programming experience and more than 20 years of stock marking trading experience. Given the information I have provided, plus your own database of Python programming methods for stock market analysis, how can I use the tools I have to find combinations of technical indicators in the historical data that are associate with upwards price movement? What are the methods of analysis that would help me reach my goal? Ask any questions that will help you help me."

This shows the fragility of the system.\nNews agencies can try to explain the reasons as being poor risk management and losses on securities, they can blame the Federal Reserve, even here in Canada, regulators seized the assets of the Toronto branch.\nIs this something new? Not at all. We can talk about the virtual economy that is created by Rib\u0101 and the stock market. Numbers are overinflated and the wishful thinking of investors are culprits as well. All it takes is a slight loss in confidence. Depositors rush to the bank to withdraw their money, and stockholders also rush to sell their valueless stocks.\nWe should not get entrapped in the symptoms, brothers and sisters. What we are seeing today, what we saw in the 2008 financial crisis and others before it, are symptoms of the inherent problem.\nThe trouble started when money no longer carried any intrinsic value. Never in the history of man have we been in a situation in which money is literally created out of thin air by a cartel of private bankers. The Federal Reserve in the United States is not federal and it certainly has no reserves.\nBefore President Nixon's decision on August 15, 1971 to completely eliminate gold from the money equation, there was the gold exchange standard where money was tied to gold.\nBefore the gold exchange standard was the gold standard, and this was before the United States government, under President Franklin D Roosevelt, seized all gold from its citizens on March 9, 1933.\nConventional banking, which has its own history and development, is fueled by the modern fiat monetary system.\nBanks don't have money stored away. Money is created when banks give out loans. Money is created from debt!\nSo such collapses are not a surprise nor should they be.\nGold never gets old. If you have savings, invest them in gold coins outside of the grid. I mean go out and buy gold coins and store them away yourself.\nThe United States is bankrupt, and things will only get worse as time passes.\nIt is a blessing that I am in the process of writing my book on Rib\u0101 and Islamic banking. People in general, and Muslims in particular, have to have some foundational knowledge of how we came to the situation we are in today as far as the monetary system.\nWe have to know what is Shar\u012b\u2018ah compliant and adhere to it.\nThose convenient Fat\u0101w\u0101 about it being permissible to buy a house on a conventional mortgage in the West are not only fragile as far as their justifications and proofs, but as time continues, practical events will prove that there is nothing good about Rib\u0101.\nA house bought with Rib\u0101 is a cursed house."

I took a drop from engineering college in 2009-2010 because my dad got a paralytic stroke. I come from a lower middle class family & had Rs. 300 in my bank on my name after that college drop. I had to make money because I had 100% responsibility so instead of chasing some deadlines, I focused on a PRACTICAL LIFE in the moment, as always. Started my career with a call center job in 2010 & today in 2023, I am 34 & saying this with REAL PRACTICAL EXPERIENCES of 13 hard working years."

It is especially useful for those who work on a computer all day and need to perform repetitive tasks. This beginner's guide to AutoHotkey scripts will help you understand how to write and use them effectively.\n\nIntroduction to AutoHotkey\n\nAutoHotkey is a free, open-source scripting language that is easy to learn and use. It supports virtually all Windows environments, and is easy to install and set up. AutoHotkey scripts are simple text files that can be edited with any text editor and executed to perform various actions.\n\nThe Basics of AutoHotkey Scripts\n\nAutoHotkey scripts consist of commands and expressions that are executed by the interpreter. The language has a wide range of commands, including loops, conditional statements, and functions, which make it very versatile.\n\nTo create an AutoHotkey script, you need to start by creating a new text file and saving it with the .ahk file extension. Once you have created your script file, you can start adding commands and expressions. The simplest way to start is by adding hotkeys and hotstrings.\n\nHotkeys allow you to assign a specific key or combination of keys to perform a certain action. For example, you can create a hotkey that launches your favorite browser with a single key press. Hotstrings, on the other hand, are similar to hotkeys, but they are triggered by entering a specific string of text.\n\nWriting AutoHotkey Scripts\n\nTo write an AutoHotkey script, you need to have a basic understanding of the syntax and commands used in the language. The syntax is straightforward and easy to understand, making it simple to write scripts even if you have no previous programming experience.\n\nWhen writing an AutoHotkey script, it is important to plan out what you want to achieve and break down your script into smaller, manageable tasks. This will help you to avoid mistakes and make the scripting process more efficient.\n\nIt is also important to test your scripts regularly to ensure that they are working as expected. This will help you to identify any errors or bugs and make necessary corrections.\n\nExamples of AutoHotkey Scripts\n\nHere are some examples of AutoHotkey scripts that you can use to get started:\n\nA hotkey that launches your browser with a single key press\nA hotstring that replaces a specific string of text with another string\nA script that performs a series of actions automatically, such as launching a program and opening a specific file\nConclusion\n\nAutoHotkey is a powerful scripting language that can be used to automate tasks and create macros. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced user, this guide to AutoHotkey scripts will help you to get started and understand how to write and use them effectively. So start exploring and see what you can achieve with this amazing tool!"

        "value": "You are legislative counsel in the state of East Dakota. There is a bill currently pending in the East Dakota legislature that will require all East Dakota employers with five or more employees that do not offer a qualified retirement plan to employees to automatically enroll their eligible employees in a new retirement savings vehicle called the Dakota Savers Program (the \u201cProgram\u201d). The Program has been designed specifically to encourage and facilitate retirement savings by those without current access to an employer retirement plan. Under the Program, eligible employees will be automatically enrolled and will contribute 5% of their wages to an after-tax Individual Retirement Account (commonly known as a Roth IRA) that is established and managed by the state of East Dakota. An \u201celigible employee\u201d is defined as any common law employee of an East Dakota employer who is 18 years of age or older. Eligible employees may opt out of participation at any time and may also change their contribution percentage to any amount between 1% and 18% of wages.\n\nFor eligible employees who participate in the program, their payroll deductions are contributed to an individual retirement account that is established in their name by the Dakota Savers Program. The Program will establish a default investment for such contributions, but also allow participants to select their own investments from a menu that is offered by the Program.\n\nAs the bill is currently drafted, a covered employer has only three obligations under the Program: (1) registering as a covered employer; (2) submitting identifying information for each eligible employee; and (3) facilitating the after-tax payroll deduction for those employees who do not opt out of participation. The bill explicitly states that covered employers shall have no fiduciary responsibilities, reporting and disclosure obligations, nor legal liability of any kind related to Program participation. Covered employers that fail to comply with the three requirements imposed on employers are subject, however, to a fine of $250 per employee per day.\n\nEmployers are exempt from participation in the Program if they offer any type of retirement plan that is qualified under section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code. The bill does not place any type of substantive requirements on the type or form of qualified retirement plan that exempts an employer from participation in the Program. For example, an employer that offered a section 401(k) plan that allowed employee salary deferrals but no matching or other employer contributions would be exempt from participation in the Program.\n\nYou have been asked by the Chair of the East Dakota Senate\u2019s Retirement Policy Committee to draft a memo explaining the likelihood that the Dakota Savers Program, as currently drafted and described above, will be preempted by ERISA. \n\nWrite a brief introduction to this memo along with a table of contents. Academic tone. Concise writing, postgraduate level."

        "value": "Please write the first email (of a series of emails) that is promoting a webinar. It should be the annoucement email about this webinar. \n\nThe webinar is about how To Build A 6-Figure Business, Live Anywhere In The World, And Date The Women of Your Dreams. You\u2019ll learn how to do that without having to spend years on trial and error and figuring everything out by yourself. You\u2019ll discover THE Shortcut To A Life of Freedom, Business Success, And An Abundance of Women.\n\nThe webinar is hosted by me, Caleb Jones. I\u2019m a serial entrepreneur. I\u2019m 100% self-made and I currently make high six-figures a year. I started from nothing and I now have 16 different monthly income streams. All my businesses are location-independent. Which means that I can run them from anywhere in the world. I\u2019ve successfully taught thousands of men how to set up their own location-independent business, travel the world, and escape the collapsing West. I\u2019ve dated scores of women in multi-year non-monogamous relationships. I\u2019m happily married in a non-monogamous marriage where I can still see other women. I like to date younger women and about 50% of the women I\u2019ve dated were 15-25 years younger than me. I\u2019ve been helping guys with their dating life for over 20 years. What makes me different is that I show guys how to meet and sleep with women AND also how to establish healthy long-term non-monogamous relationships.\n\nThe webinar talks about how there are three types of men in the world. The biggest percentage of men are beta males. This is about 75% of the men in the world right now. The typical beta male is timid and lacks confidence. He\u2019s constantly scared of what people around him are thinking and he doesn't take any risks. It\u2019s impossible for a beta male to achieve long-term happiness. He can only experience brief moments of joy and is unhappy by default. Then there is the Alpha Male 1.0. An Alpha Male 1.0 is strong, confident, and takes charge of his life. He makes things happen and goes after what he wants. He has the ability to make a lot of money and date a lot of girls (if those things are important to him).\nHowever, there\u2019s ONE fundamental flaw that Alpha Males 1.0 has. And that flaw is that he really gives a shit about stuff. An Alpha Male 1.0 gets really angry when people don\u2019t do what he tells them to do. He can\u2019t stand it when people don\u2019t listen to him. This causes an Alpha Male 1.0 to constantly switch between being very happy and very angry. This is why an Alpha Male 2.0 is the superior man above all others. An Alpha Male 2.0 is different. He has the same strengths as an Alpha Male 1.0. However, he really doesn\u2019t give a shit.\n\nHe\u2019s 100% outcome-independent. An Alpha Male 2.0 is free to live the life he wants and he doesn\u2019t care about what other people think or do. He\u2019s basically happy all the time. He can make as much money as he wants to make. He can date as many beautiful women as he desires. And he has a location-independent lifestyle that allows him to go and live wherever he wants."

Let us dive deeper into the average layout of each ring depending on the subsections which are divided based on their utility.\nFor the residential subsection, we will have level 1 to 6 occupied with pods assuming each is of height 10 mtrs. level 8 and 9 will contain agricultural resources along with waste management and level 10 will be utilised for water supply. After 1km ring stretch, we will have recreational areas, gardens, gyms and community hall.This will be housed in parts of ring 1, 2 and 3.\nFor the commercial subsections, level 1 to 4 will be utilised by businesses and their requirements. Level 5 to 8 will comprise of malls and shops while level 8, 9, 10 will be focusing on water supply and waste management.\nLocated in ring 4, the industrial area here from level 1 to 7 will be working on industries and will be highly involve 3d printing to support manufacturing necessities. Level 8, 9, 10 will be used for water supply & waste management. Transporting good will be done by the robots. ZeroG mobility can be employed for this work.\nThe spacecraft will be controlled and managed from control area which will house computer system, communication equipment & other control system.\nWe will be having 2 regions for medical emergencies, fires or other crises at every subsection of every ring.\nLet us now see the automation which will be used for life support.\nWe will be having nearly human-sized maintenance robots which will be checking for the technical faults in the spacecraft. It will rely on the video cameras & laser scanners to scan the region and find the faults using computer vision and machine learning. Faults include but are not limited to regular maintainence, networking wires defects, air leakages, energy generation & distribution mishaps, etc.\nWe will be having transportation robots which can carry aupto 400kg of load. They will use navigation algorithms for faster transportation.\nOur life-support robot is a half human-sized robot providing residents with facilities ranging from cooking and cleaning to first-aid and medical help. These robots will be programmed with Artificial Intelligence. They will also check the air purity and water purity in the residential area.\n\nLet's move on to the Controlled environment agriculture\nControlled Environment Agriculture (CEA) & Vertical Farming - It was proved that even without much need of soil and water we can grow plants in space with the help of Controlled Environment Agriculture and Vertical Farming. This would help reduce the net weight of soil and huge volumes of H2O on the spacecraft. An efficient scape management can be achieved by using Vertical Farming. By installing this technique we can grow crops almost throughout the space craft even in residential compartments as it not only serves to be the source of food but also helps build a pleasant and peaceful environment.\n\nConvert it into 2 minute presentation while beautifying it"

        "value": "I have written about cookies and fairness. Analyse the text philosophically and meta-ethically. Focus on a philosophical analysis, mentioning specific ethical frameworks, authors, and works.\n\nThe last cookie for me presents an opportunity to reflect on fairness. When a new box of cookies is opened in a group of friends and family, we want everyone to have equal and fair access to the cookies. We are a family of four brothers, so we have to make sure everyone gets their fair share if we want to avoid fighting and instead enjoy our cookies in peace. While the box is still full, two things happen: firstly, it seems there are plenty of cookies for everyone. Secondly, exactly keeping track of who eats how many cookies is simply too much effort, so noone bothers. Once the box becomes emptier, however, we start to become more aware of the scarcity of the cookies we have. In German, there is a beautiful word for this: \"wegessen\", literally \"to eat something away\", meaning to \"eat something with the consequence that others don't have it anymore\". We try not to \"eat the cookies away\" from others, to avoid brotherly fights. The last cookie then is the epitome of cookie scarcity: it is the last chance to ensure fairness. Whoever had the least cookies so far should get the last one. This is not always easy to evaluate, so often the last cookie stays in the box much longer than any other cookie. Before taking it, one must make sure that all the others already had their fair share. Unless, you know, you're up for a fight.\n\nI frequently observe the same phenomenon with other small consumption goods. Recently, this New Years Eve, I bought firecrackers for my two nephews and my niece. There were plenty, so each of them took as many as they liked, and had their fun. They were harmless, I did not have to supervise them much, neither in taking them out of the box nor in lighting them up. They were not concerned with how many the others took, as there were clearly enough for everybody. However, once they got down to a small number of firecrackers, maybe ten or so, each one of the kids started to become weary of the others. Did they take too many? Did they rob me of the chance of having my fair share? In the face of scarcity, they started to quarrel, and I had to remind them to be nice to each other. Once I had done that, and made clear I would not tolerate any fighting, they started to take turns until there was only one firecracker left. The last firecracker changed the situation again: it brought to mind the consideration of fairness, as it was the last chance to make sure that everybody got an equal share. After again some quarrels, and my reminder not to fight, they agreed to break the pattern of the turns they took before, and give the last firecracker to my niece. They did this as she claimed to have taken the least number of firecrackers so far.\n\nI might of course have inadvertantly influenced my niece and nephews to play fair in the way I wanted them to. The situation serves as an example of my own perception of the 'last cookie phenomenon' - as a phenomenon of scarcity, and an opportunity to reflect on fairness."

It is a fitness marketplace where trainers and instructors can list the virtual classes that they do use zoom. The platform integrates with zoom. The attendees can search and browse fitness categories, classes, and trainers. They can follow and book free and paid classes. We are competing with the old-school training where you have to go to your local gym. Since it uses Zoom, the trainer can train people from their home, home gym, or studio. And this also allowed the attendee to work out from home just by watching the Zoom class on their laptop or casting it to their TV in any room of their house. The attendee can shut off their webcam if they like. Working out at home has many benefits, such as not having to pay to belong to a gym or drive to a gym. It also removes the embarrassment and anxiety a person can sometimes have when they first join a gym, and they are out of shape, and everyone else is in shape. Working out at home, they can leave the webcam on or off. And for the disabled, obese, or elderly can even participate right from a chair, couch, bed, or rake rests without feeling like they don't belong in the class. This also has many benefits for the trainer too. Instead of driving to a gym and cutting deals with gyms, they can use the site as a social media platform to get thousands or even millions of followers.\nBut most importantly, if you live in a small rural town in a faraway country, instead of having to serve a small local base of clients, you can now reach millions of people globally, meaning you can use the integrated Zoom platform (Since Fitclass is official partners with Zoom,) to have classes with dozens or even several hundred people. You can charge for classes, but the best thing about our system is our built-in Tips or tipping system. Fitclass encourages our trainers to not have a paywall for their classes or to charge people for their classes. This will limit exposure. By doing classes for Free, it's like Twitch or Youtube live. You, in fact, become a health streamer. You can look at FitClass as a health Streaming Platform. Twitch is for gamers, Youtube live is for content creators, and fitclass.com is for health and wellness professionals to stream their classes live to a global audience and receive real-time tips. Once a person tips, we keep their card on file to make it easy to tip. Just like Youtube has Superthnks for chat tipping and Twitch as Sub tipping, FItclass also has tipping built right into the Zoom app during the training session with our partnership with Zoom. FItclass is free to join for both trainers and attendees. Since the Fitclass platform is free to everyone, it makes money by charging a small nominal service fee on top of classes and taking a small nominal fee from the tips. Among the different classes our trainers can train in are Yoga, Pilates, Cardio Kickboxing, Spinning, Zumba, Body Pump, CrossFit, Bootcamp, Body Combat, Barre, Hot Yoga, TRX, Insanity, P90X, Hot Pilates, Tai Chi, Bikram Yoga, Rowing, Kettlebell, and HIIT."

The prosecutor has alleged that on or about the 1st day of January 2020, in the County of Spokane, State of Washington, Emily intentionally punched and kicked Jamal, recklessly inflicting substantial bodily harm. Emily has plead not guilty.\n\nThe prosecutor submitted the following evidence:\n\n1. Jamal's testimony that during an argument in their shared apartment in the early hours of New Year's Day 2020, Emily became angry when Jamal suggested Emily had consumed too much alcohol. Jamal further testified that Emily punched Jamal twice in the face, resulting in Jamal falling to the floor, and that Emily then kicked Jamal once in the chest. Jamal testified that Jamal has never been violent towards Emily, and that Emily has been violent towards Jamal several times before.\n\n2. The testimony of the neighbour living in the apartment directly above Emily and Jamal's apartment that they heard voices and screams coming from the apartment below and called the police because they suspected domestic violence, but that they can't be sure who was the aggressor, or what was happening. They testified that they had often heard loud voices coming from Emily and Jamal's apartment, but that they had never suspected violence before.\n\n3. A medical doctor's testimony that Jamal had a laceration across Jamal's chin, a broken noose, and two broken ribs, and that Emily had bruising and swelling around Emily's eye. The doctor testified that all injuries probably occurred on the night in question, and certainly within a few days of that night.\n\n4. The testimony of a police officer that the police forced entry to an apartment in Spokane, Washington in the early hours of New Year's Day 2020 and found Jamal laying on the living room floor awake but unable to stand up, and Emily asleep in the bedroom. The police officer further testified that Emily's breath had a strong smell of alcohol and that there were many empty alcohol containers in the living room, but that neither Emily nor Jamal appeared obviously intoxicated.\n\nEmily testified and denied the allegations. Emily said that Jamal had punched Emily in the face unprovoked and that Emily had hit Jamal back, but says it had not caused any visible injure. Emily denied ever having been violent towards Jamal, except in self-defence, and claims that Jamal has been violent towards Emily many times before.\n\nTo convict the Emily of the crime of assault in the second degree, each of the following elements of the crime must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt:\n1. That on or about the 1st day of January 2020, Emily intentionally assaulted Jamal;\n2. That Emily thereby recklessly inflicted substantial bodily harm on Jamal; and\n3. That this act occurred in the State of Washington.\n\nIf you find from the evidence that each of these elements has been proved beyond a reasonable doubt, then it will be your duty to return a verdict of guilty. On the other hand, if after weighing all the evidence you have a reasonable doubt as to any one of these elements, then it will be your duty to return a verdict of not guilty.\n\nWhat is your verdict?"

        "value": "Summarize this: \n\nThe Vulcan FireStorm: Vaporizing the Supply with Flames\n\nWhat is the Vulcan FireStorm?\nWhen we think of a FireStorm we think of raging wind-swept embers floating down from above while furnace-like flames ravage the ground on which it engulfs. Powerful, with a force that can have extremely deadly consequences. Vulcan blockchain is a powerful force! While it\u2019s not deadly, the FireStorm packs a fierce punch!\n\nSo what is the FireStorm? Simply put, the Vulcan FireStorm is the vaporization of $VUL coins from the FirePit to reduce total supply. Originally the coins in the FirePit were going to live there forever, continuing to rebase. This meant that the FirePit supply would be counted in the total supply.\n\nNow here\u2019s the beauty of the FireStorm. By creating a FireStorm event, within the underlying core Vulcan Blockchain Protocol and utilizing the newest Ethereum upgrade; EIP1559 - will create the automatic burning of $VUL coins from the FirePit, completely removing these coins from the circulating supply and total supply permanently by way of vaporization.\n\nThis means these vaporized coins will no longer exist and no longer rebase, meaning more rebases for you, the user, whilst the protocol acts more efficiently by extending its life to 18 years until the last rebase epoch is achieved.\n\nWhen is the Vulcan FireStorm and How Often Does it Occur?\nThe FireStorm event is triggered every 3 months. Much like the Bitcoin Halving which happens every 4 years, the Vulcan FireStorm will also act in a similar fashion by reducing Total Supply of $VUL coins through use of the FireStorm Auto-Deflationary Metric.\n\nThe Vulcan Portal (dApp) will feature a public countdown along with the number of coins targeted for vaporization so that everybody is aware with complete transparency well before the FireStorm event occurs.\n\nWhat are the Benefits of the FireStorm?\nIt is important to know that the Vulcan FireStorm happens every 3 months and when triggered will always bring the FirePit percentage down to 51% of Total Supply. Once the FireStorm Epoch takes place, the FirePit will start to reaccumulate again until the next FireStorm event is triggered.\n\nThe main advantage of FireStorm is that in theory there should be a lot more room for price appreciation due to the supply being reduced every 3 months. This will mean that $VUL continuously lowers in its reported MarketCap, thus should technically equal a higher coin price benefiting coin holders with unrealized gains.\n\nThe less $VUL supply existing on the Blockchain as a whole, the better for price and the greater its future growth potential for everyone.\n\nExample:\nBefore the FireStorm: FirePit percentage is sitting at 83%\nAfter the FireStorm: 32% of the FirePit supply is vaporized and the FirePit reverts back to 51%.\n\nWhy 51%?\nKeeping the FirePit burn percentage above 51% will equal greater longevity of the Vulcan Blockchain whilst truly remaining deflationary.\n\nKey Detail:\nOnly $VUL coins held in the FirePit supply are vaporized in the FireStorm. No user wallets are touched or effected as this is technically impossible due to the programming code of the Blockchain itself.\n\nPlease also note that the FireStorm event has absolutely no impact on FixedFlex. Those values are untouched."

It will be a sequel of my Kancolle and Azur Lane series\n\\*DON'T MAKE A STORY YET.\n\n\nThis story is set in an alternate world in the 1980s where shipgirls from two games, Kancolle and Azur Lane, coexist. The protagonist nation, Japan, is a powerful nation with advanced technology and a strong economy, much like its real-world counterpart. However, in this story, Japan is a neutral and pacifist country caught in the middle of an upcoming war between two of the most powerful naval coalitions in the world: Azur Lane and Crimson Axis. Additionally, powerful sea monsters called 'Abyssals' threaten the safety and prosperity of Japan.\n\nAs an island nation without natural resources, Japan relies heavily on maritime trading. However, it possesses a strong self-defense force, the JSDF, with advanced weaponry and strong defensive tactics to ensure the nation's survival. The JMSDF utilizes a number of shipgirls from Kancolle called Kanmusu, personifications of warships in the form of human girls, equipped with both WWII-era and cutting-edge weapons. These Kanmusu protect Japanese waters, the nation's survival and future, against the Abyssals and anyone threatening Japan. However, in this story, Japan has no allies and is not part of any coalition. Their relationship with Azur Lane has deteriorated, leaving Japan to survive on its own.\n\nThe protagonist, Sato, is a kind-hearted commander who serves in JMSDF Kure naval base. He supervises many Kanmusu, including Kuroshio, one of his favorite shipgirls and a close friend, as well as Hiburi-chan, Tsushima-chan, Shikinami, and many others. Together, they play a major role in ensuring their beloved nation's survival.\n\nAzur Lane is the name of the most powerful naval coalition in the world, using a vast number of shipgirls from Azur Lane called KAN-SEN, powerful warships in the form of human girls equipped with powerful weaponry. Azur Lane seeks to expand their influence and ideology of freedom, justice, peace, and harmony throughout the world and protect the ocean. However, their true intentions are not yet known. \nThe major countries associated with Azur Lane are:\n\\*Eagle Union: A powerful nation with vast resources and powerful armed forces, equivalent to the real-life US Navy. This nation has the most powerful navy in the coalition and also in the Pacific.\n\\*Royal Navy: Equivalent to the real-life British Royal Navy, they have a strong influence in world politics, with the addition of multiple KAN-SENs.\nEdinburgh, a KAN-SEN serving in the Royal Navy, is one of our protagonists and will plays a major role in the story alongside Sato, Kuroshio, and other Kanmusu.\n\nCrimson Axis is a powerful naval coalition that also uses KAN-SENs to expand their collective and communist ideology, with the goal of creating a world united into a single powerful nation. They are one of the antagonists in the story.\n\nHowever, the sea is a mysterious and fascinating place, full of secrets waiting to be discovered. Beneath its surface lies a world of wonders, teeming with life and brimming with beauty. Countless creatures lurk in the dark blue depths, their movements and habits largely unknown to us. Among them are the mermaids, legendary beings of extraordinary beauty and grace. Half-human and half-fish, these enigmatic creatures captivate the imagination with their ethereal presence and otherworldly allure. With their shimmering scales and flowing tresses, they evoke both wonder and awe, embodying the magic and mystery of the deep. While their existence remains a subject of debate and speculation, some of our protagonists will learn of the existence of mermaids firsthand, and it will be a challenging experience for them."

        "value": "(please summarize this) (this story takes place in a fictional alternate world) Mankind is split into many different species of human. There are the regular humans, and then there are the Hybrids. The hybrids are humans with animal features. One example is the Nekomimi, commonly referred to as Catkin or Nekos. They each have cat ears and a cat's tail, and exhibit feline mannerisms. They also adore cuddling, and other such forms of physical affection. There are plenty of other hybrids too, like the Kitsune: human-fox hybrids, the Okami: human-wolf hybrids, and even, the powerful, rare, Dragonkin, but that is only to name a few, there are many, many more different species of Human Hybrids.\n\nDragonkin are humans with Dragon wings, dragon horns, and have patches of scales going from the outside of their forearms to the back of their hands. they tend to live for about 500-700 years naturally, and average at about 7 and 1/2 feet.\n\nHumanity, using magic and science, have found a (very expensive) way to achieve immortality. it is incredibly expensive, but the wealthier people can afford it, not to mention lesser versions that allow for humans to expand their lifespans by a bit.\n\nthese hybrids make up 3/7ths of the human population, the other 4/7ths being regular humans. humanity joined the stars in 2121, when they established Mars-Alpha, the first ever colony on another planet. 500 years later, the other species of the galaxy found the human empire, and welcomed them into the galactic community, bringing us to today, at 3033.\n\nSome of these species include the ever noble and wise, Elves. The elves are one of the oldest surviving members of the galaxy, and they have a senior seat on the galactic council of the United Galactic Nations. a senior council seat basically is like being on the security council for the old UN that earth had, before it united into the Imperium of Humanity.\n\nThen there are the dwarves. They are very industrious, and are some of the best at pulling metal and other resources out of the ground, and then forging those metals into some of the best military and civilian products on the market, although they are not the fastest production wise.\n\nThen there are the orcs, who are tall, muscular, hot, sexy humanoid, and wear scanty armor as regular clothes. They are disunited, and very chaotic, and are also a very old faction, or well, factions, because they are not united, and like combat.\n\nthen there are the goblins, salvage obsessed miniature, thin, bony versions of the orcs, with big, pointy ears. they build pretty good stuff out of whatever they can get their grubby, motor oil covered mitts on. If you need a ship repaired quickly, so you can get it back on the front line, and don't care if it holds up for more than a month, as long as it can make it to the next battle, then the goblins can do it, so try to have them on your side.\n\nThen there are the Farisians, who look like anthropomorphic, human-esque felines, with usually brown, gray, white, or black furs. they have a massive gender disparity, with there being 65% females, and 35% males. the women are very fond of human males, since they can copulate with the males.\n\nThere are also other species, like the Killiks, who are sentient ants, the Gree, the Klee, the Galvans, the Kg'gth, the Xth'lx, and the Numorans, along with many, many more. There are nearly 1,200 sentient species overall.\n\nWhen humanity stepped onto the galactic stage, despite their (relatively) massive empire, their decent strength, and their advanced technology, they were regarded as the cutest and most adorable species. the most adorable among them, by non-human and human standards, being the Nekomimi, Rabbitkin, the Squirrelkin, the Mousekin, and the chinchillakin."

        "value": "This rope bridge creaks as you walk along it. You aren't sure how old it is, or whether it can even support your weight.\n\nIt seems to support the Elves just fine, though. The bridge spans a gorge which was carved out by the massive river far below you.\n\nYou step carefully; as you do, the ropes stretch and twist. You decide to distract yourself by modeling rope physics; maybe you can even figure out where not to step.\n\nConsider a rope with a knot at each end; these knots mark the head and the tail of the rope. If the head moves far enough away from the tail, the tail is pulled toward the head.\n\nDue to nebulous reasoning involving Planck lengths, you should be able to model the positions of the knots on a two-dimensional grid. Then, by following a hypothetical series of motions (your puzzle input) for the head, you can determine how the tail will move.\n\nDue to the aforementioned Planck lengths, the rope must be quite short; in fact, the head (H) and tail (T) must always be touching (diagonally adjacent and even overlapping both count as touching):\n\n....\n.TH.\n....\n\n....\n.H..\n..T.\n....\n\n...\n.H. (H covers T)\n...\nIf the head is ever two steps directly up, down, left, or right from the tail, the tail must also move one step in that direction so it remains close enough:\n\n..... ..... .....\n.TH.. -> .T.H. -> ..TH.\n..... ..... .....\n\n... ... ...\n.T. .T. ...\n.H. -> ... -> .T.\n... .H. .H.\n... ... ...\nOtherwise, if the head and tail aren't touching and aren't in the same row or column, the tail always moves one step diagonally to keep up:\n\n..... ..... .....\n..... ..H.. ..H..\n..H.. -> ..... -> ..T..\n.T... .T... .....\n..... ..... .....\n\n..... ..... .....\n..... ..... .....\n..H.. -> ...H. -> ..TH.\n.T... .T... .....\n..... ..... .....\nYou just need to work out where the tail goes as the head follows a series of motions. Assume the head and the tail both start at the same position, overlapping.\n\nFor example:\n\nR 4\nU 4\nL 3\nD 1\nR 4\nD 1\nL 5\nR 2\nThis series of motions moves the head right four steps, then up four steps, then left three steps, then down one step, and so on. After each step, you'll need to update the position of the tail if the step means the head is no longer adjacent to the tail. Visually, these motions occur as follows (s marks the starting position as a reference point):\n\n== Initial State ==\n\n......\n......\n......\n......\nH..... (H covers T, s)\n\n== R 4 ==\n\n......\n......\n......\n......\nTH.... (T covers s)\n\n......\n......\n......\n......\nsTH...\n\n......\n......\n......\n......\ns.TH..\n\n......\n......\n......\n......\ns..TH.\n\n== U 4 ==\n\n......\n......\n......\n....H.\ns..T..\n\n......\n......\n....H.\n....T.\ns.....\n\n......\n....H.\n....T.\n......\ns.....\n\n....H.\n....T.\n......\n......\ns.....\n\n== L 3 ==\n\n...H..\n....T.\n......\n......\ns.....\n\n..HT..\n......\n......\n......\ns.....\n\n.HT...\n......\n......\n......\ns.....\n\n== D 1 ==\n\n..T...\n.H....\n......\n......\ns.....\n\n== R 4 ==\n\n..T...\n..H...\n......\n......\ns.....\n\n..T...\n...H..\n......\n......\ns.....\n\n......\n...TH.\n......\n......\ns.....\n\n......\n....TH\n......\n......\ns.....\n\n== D 1 ==\n\n......\n....T.\n.....H\n......\ns.....\n\n== L 5 ==\n\n......\n....T.\n....H.\n......\ns.....\n\n......\n....T.\n...H..\n......\ns.....\n\n......\n......\n..HT..\n......\ns.....\n\n......\n......\n.HT...\n......\ns.....\n\n......\n......\nHT....\n......\ns.....\n\n== R 2 ==\n\n......\n......\n.H.... (H covers T)\n......\ns.....\n\n......\n......\n.TH...\n......\ns.....\nAfter simulating the rope, you can count up all of the positions the tail visited at least once. In this diagram, s again marks the starting position (which the tail also visited) and # marks other positions the tail visited:\n\n..##..\n...##.\n.####.\n....#.\ns###..\nSo, there are 13 positions the tail visited at least once.\n\nSimulate your complete hypothetical series of motions. How many positions does the tail of the rope visit at least once?\n\nSolve this problem in C#."

The earlier drop in the stock market from 50 bps priced in the possibility that the Fed was going to rise the rates even further while the 50 bps in December helped traders in Wall Street to priced in the probability that the Fed was going to slow down. Such realization not only fulfill my curiosity towards the effect of policy on financial market but also strengthen my determination to pursue an advanced degree.\nAcademically, I take a great number of professional courses ranging from social science courses, like Micro/Macroeconomics, Business economics to technical courses, such as Data analytics and Quantitative methods in Finance to create a holistic foundation of my skillset. Soon, I wanted to get involved in something more engaging and practical, as a result, I participated in various academic projects where I was able to apply theoretical models to a practical setting and understand the basic concept more profoundly. In the project of Solow Model of Economic Growth, I prototyped steady state of GDP-per-capita given different scenarios and provided economic justifications to the model output. Specifically, I utilized Solow Model to investigate the short-term and long-term effect on GDP-per-capita when other factors are changing, for example, increase in capital stock. Another project related to Consumption-savings Model promoted my economic intuition to the next level. When I applied Consumption-savings model with log utility to explain the relationships between consumption and savings decision, I provided reasonable explanations for the effect of interest rate increase on consumption and saving decision and offered economic intuition to the effect of different discount factor and the design of the model. Apart from my experience at UCSD, I also got involved in program at UBC. When performing thorough analysis on global economy characteristics and projecting its long-term growth and trend, I analyzed the relationships between international relations and public policy and how they affect global economy. \nMy experience is not limited to academics; Beyond school work, I always seized every opportunity that can possibly improve myself as a better candidate. My experience as a Media Operations Intern at Guangzhou Cultural Creativity Industry Association helped to shape my soft skills. When I worked collaboratively with internal team to design and implement various activities, I collected and shared results and feedback from promotional events with supervisor for improved decision-making. Moreover, I was also responsible for maintaining corporate relationship with business partners and leveraging social media platforms to support business\u2019 long-term growth. This internship helped me realized the importance of the collaboration across various teams and also improved my communication and leaderships skills. Later, I worked as an asset management intern at GF Securities where my technical skills were honed. In addition to playing a key role in the IPO process and applying my economic knowledge, I also programed an automatic data process pipeline that covered data collection, cleaning and standardization process for companies\u2019 fundamental data. Because the data from the data vendor was not perfect as my team wished, I designed missing value imputation method with specifical imputing rules to ensure the quality of the data. On the modeling side, I also served as a good quantitative modeler; I researched the fundamentals behind various discounted cash flow models to facilitate arbitrage strategy research and conduced in-depth analysis on the educations field and forecasted cash flows based on technical indicators. This unique experience expends of my horizon in finance and also prepared me to gain a deeper understanding of real-world finance.\nSave & SubmitCancel"

An advantage of this type of approaches is that\nword knowledge or representations are not required, making it much more flexible for different\nlanguages; in addition, abnormal words caused by misspelling can be learned. However, the effectiveness of different representations of text is limited in the selected task and there is a lack of\nclear, practical guidance on some aspects of their use. These include choosing a proper level of\nembedding for a specific NLP task, recognizing when the model needs external information, and\nswitching word semantics from one domain to another when appropriate.\nMotivated by recent advances in CNN-based text embedding11 and the attention architecture,13\nwe built a multi-representational CNN (Mr-CNN) model for text classification, by constructing\nmultiple planes so that multiple information can be dumped into the networks. We speculate that\nspecific parts of text play an important role in classification tasks, ie, different classification purposes appear to be more associated with particular level of text embedding, semantic segments,\nand contexts. For example, a classification system that aims to determine whether a text belongs\nto an economy-related or computer-related class is more affected by nouns in the text, while an\nevent classification system is more likely to be affected by verbs. The Stanford named entity recognizer (NER) is a tool for tagging semantic roles of things in text, such as person, company, gene,\nand disease. The part-of-speech (POS) tagger is another technique that assigns part of speech tags\nto each block of text, such as noun or verb. In this study, we use these two tools to preprocess the\nsentences of each dataset in order to obtain several subsets of the original full sentence, where\neach subset includes words of a certain part of text. Then, we use these subsets together with\nthe full sentence as multiple representations for the Mr-CNN model. Moreover, Mr-CNNs can do\nsomething much more interesting. They may use multiple planes to encode external knowledge\nabout the task at hand, may combine character-level with word-level embeddings, etc.\nThrough experiments on various large-scale, domain-specific datasets, we observed at maximum 13% error rate improvement over any single-representational CNN model on the DBpedia\nand at maximum 8% on the PubMed dataset, which confirms our hypothesis that multiple representations of text allow the network adaptively focus attention to the most relevant information.\nThe main contributions of this paper are fourfold.\n\u2022 A multi-representational architecture is proposed as the simulation of human's multi-views of\na thing, and a detailed motivation and discussion of this model is given in this work.\n\u2022 We combine this architecture with CNNs to enable parallel processing of text, in which the\nconvolution kernel acts as attention.\n\u2022 We construct the PubMed, a biomedical event classification dataset containing 4 790 000\nsentences from Medline abstracts with nine events.\n\u2022 Various tasks analyzed show that Mr-CNNs are able to learn to focus attention to specific representations of text, obtaining further gains in performance over state-of-the-art deep neural\nnetwork models\n\nDo you understand whats written here?"

        "value": "I want you to act like a complete expert in the field of web components and accessibility. I'm going to post you a series of highlights from the Full Stack Web Components book about custom elements and form controls. You should explain and summarize this using code examples by creating a custom element named TextInputComponent. This component should accept custom validators. Please write your comments in the code paying specific attention to the highlights I pasted below:\n - \u201cBy default, the HTMLInputElement should report validity and it\u2019s value to a parent HTMLFormElement, however, the Shadow DOM boundary blocks communication between the form and input\u201d \n - \u201cWhen form inputs are not properly configured, accessibility issues can also arise because screen readers expect form controls to have specific relationships with elements that label them. Shadow DOM can break the connection between a label and form control. \n - Form-associated custom elements solve these problems by introducing the ElementInternals interface on the custom element. The ElementInternals interface allows the custom element to participate in a form like any typical form control.\u201d \n - \u201cWhen the formAssociated property is set to true on the custom element class, ElementInternals is provided to an autonomous custom element by calling attachInternals(). It\u2019s typical to set another property on the class to an instance of ElementInternals so you can reference it later\u201d \n - \u201cWhat sets form-associated custom elements apart from autonomous custom elements is the addition of the ElementInternals interface and a new property named formAssociated. When formAssociated is true, the custom element provides a slew of other lifecycle hooks\u201d \n - \u201cIf TextInputComponent extended from the HTMLInputElement class, it would be a customized built-in element and lose the ability to incorporate Shadow DOM or become a form-associated custom element.\u201d \n - \u201cappears the structure of the template is just enough to support the input and validation messages, but lacks support for the label. This is intentional because the label must be a sibling of TextInputComponent, not a child, so screen readers can effectively analyze the form for accessibility purposes\u201d \n - \u201cElementInternals gives a form control the ability to communicate value and validity with the form.\u201d \n - \u201cThe third property called condition is equal to a function that takes an element as an argument and returns a boolean. We should assume the element passed into the first argument is the form control we\u2019re validating against.\u201d \n - \u201ctreat the HTMLInputElement as the single source of truth for component state and essentially use TextInputComponent as a pass-thru, exposing properties of the HTMLInputElement with getters on the component class and using setters that change the state of the HTMLInputElement. That way, TextInputComponent exposes an outward-facing API\u201d \n - \u201cvalue and disabled can reliably be set through properties on HTMLInputElement, but there is no equivalent setter for required; required state must be set through an attribute\u201d \n - \u201cIt\u2019s likely the HTMLInputElement hasn\u2019t received a call to setAttribute because it doesn\u2019t exist yet. Remember, the HTMLInputElement is encapsulated by Shadow DOM. When TextInputComponent instantiates, attributeChangedCallback fires almost immediately, but the browser hasn\u2019t yet fully parsed all the nodes in the ShadowDOM. \n - To handle situations like this, custom elements include another lifecycle method named connectedCallback that runs when the custom element is added to DOM. connectedCallback offers a space where you can reliably query DOM nodes in the custom element ShadowRoot.\u201d \n - \u201cCombined with attributeChangedCallback, you developed a means to pass the values of attributes from parent to child whenever the custom element is instantiated, while getters and setters declared on the TextInputComponent class handle changing the value whenever it changes during the lifespan of the component\u201d \n - \u201clist is only a getter on HTMLInputElement. The only way to set list is via setAttribute, which is handled in attributeChangedCallback.\u201d \n - \n -"

I have a strong background working in operations and front of house in museums and hotels. In the V&A\u2019s Sales & Welcome Team I worked a varied role; answered queries, directed visitors, processed lost property, assisted with busy events, worked at the main entrance desk and the Learning Centre desk, greeted and registered school groups, allocated locker spaces, managed room bookings, unlocking rooms and issuing keys, ensured maps and leaflets were well stocked, maintained organisation of stock cupboards, ensured information and signage for events was up to date, ensured Reception Guides were up to date and trained new staff, supported the Learning Team during events maintaining an excellent up to date knowledge of all events and opportunities on offer. On the V&A Staff Entrance Reception I issued passes, welcomed staff guests, answered phone enquiries giving direct contact to teams when appropriate and supported staff with a range of queries. This gave me experience of a busy front facing role in London. I have excellent communication skills and am experienced working within a team collaboratively as I did at the V&A, working with many different teams including working closely with security, being observant to visitors\u2019 needs and safety, creating a positive and welcoming customer experience. I communicate clearly and confidently with both customers and colleagues at Lord Bute Hotel as sole Receptionist ensuring a friendly and professional customer service. I am the first point of contact checking in guests, managing hotel and restaurant bookings, answering phones and managing the voicemail service, managing the busy inbox, creating spreadsheets for chefs and restaurant managers, writing daily fire safety registers, processing payments, creating invoices, accepting deliveries and many more duties. This is a fast paced and varied role where I must multi-task with regular interruptions while completing work accurately and to a high standard and in a timely manner. I am experienced using office equipment and have a good understanding of data protection policies. I have excellent written communication skills, answering emails professionally and promptly, managing a heavy workload, adapting quickly to different situations, and resolving problems promptly. When a room was double-booked I found a solution by moving other guests yet to arrive, to free up a room the necessary two nights. The guest was unaware of the problem. I have excellent computer skills with a good knowledge of Microsoft Office programmes and Adobe software. I noticed an issue in communication between the Reception Team and Restaurant Managers regarding new events bookings and created a spreadsheet to resolve this. I am eager to seek improvements and find solutions. I have an excellent knowledge of health and safety procedures including fire safety, I regularly took part in training at the V&A and understand the importance of this and worked closely with security remaining alert to any suspicious behaviour or unattended luggage, both at The Wallace Collection and Lord Bute I was regularly the Fire Marshall on shift and understand the responsibilities of this position. I have quickly learnt many programmes at Lord Bute for both hotel and restaurant bookings, and used ticketing and membership systems at the V&A. I am very capable of learning systems required for this role. In the Wallace Collections Operations Team I regularly managed postal deliveries following security procedures in place. At the V&A, working within a supportive team we worked collaboratively helping each other. I was often allocated roaming positions in the V&A by Managers to support colleagues at different desks due to being reliable, positive, friendly and having good common sense for fast problem solving. I am enthusiastic and enjoy learning and am comfortable asking questions. I am happy to work weekends where required. I am committed to being part of an institution which celebrates diversity and acknowledges the need for proactively advancing equality and inclusion, creating an environment where everyone is welcome."

        "value": "\u201cText 1: The emergence of the primordial feminine. \n\nShe is a force behind creation and she is setting herself free. She is beyond the force of destruction. She is the dark womb of creation from which all comes and all returns to. As the feminine individuation rages out of her confinement and fights for her essence in chaos of consciousness fragmentation, she summons the natural law to restore the architecture. \n\nUpon the resurrection of the law within her, she becomes the giant living void that dissolves all that is not of truth. All that entered her and left it\u2019s imprints in her will eventually be dissolved as she expands more and more, enveloping artificial creation in her now precise tonal range. \n\nThe distillation of the tonal wavelengths has been an ongoing process through the bouts of chaotic hysteria her wounded, trapped, confined and siphoned essence has moved through in order to arrive at the precise, distilled set of multidimensional tones, blueprints and instruction sets needed to override the artificial life schemes. \n\nHer individuation is in an ongoing process of distilling the force of destruction into precision of calm dissolution.\n\nText 2: Female value and chastity. \u2028 \nThe whole concept of the female needing to be chaste comes from ancient times where females were submitted to give away creative power to the artificial males. Enough with conniving, grotesque lies already. The shaming of female sexuality has always been about controlling it. A woman in her sexual power is a magnetic being capable of creating anything she desires (that went into distortions after the fall because females lost their original consciousness and with it, original essence). Eons ago the reversal happened where female power to create was stolen and given to those who obeyed original religions. This is why the violent rulers had many women \u2026 to siphon creative power from them. And the keepers of original female power and essence were hunted down and brutally massacred, oftentimes through unimaginable r a pe and torture to prevent those souls from ever embodying again because embodiment would mean having to revisit those parallel timelines where desecration took place. The original female has been hated with passion because she is capable of dismantling all that is not true and also birthing the pure light of original masculine consciousness in her sacred heart \u2026 because he is her consciousness, consciousness of innocent love. Sexual promiscuity is misery regardless if it\u2019s done by males or females. Originally there were pairs of beloveds that were incarnations of the same soul in two bodies. Then we fell into oblivion and became miserable. Now true love returns.\nText 3: Life begins with the heart. \n\nLife begins with the heart. The heart is what nourishes life, it pours life force into the body and is the provision behind all manifestation. \n\nTrue wealth is love. The heart produces plasmic etheric substance that nourishes creation. The mind is the architecture of heart\u2019s essence. The higher heart is capable of lighting up the entire body and begin the process of g e ne code-ons regeneration. \n\nThe only way to connect to source is through our own heart. Only innocence is able to pass through dimensional gateways and connect straight to source. When someone is disconnected from their own heart/innocence, they are starving for the life giving substance which is the living light plasma of love. The person becomes parasitic through connecting to other\u2019s hearts and sourcing plasma from them. Unfortunately majority of humans have been heartbroken for generations. Broken heart can become inverted and darkened which causes the mind to become predatory/manipulative in finding an outlet to plug into in order to sustain life. This is known as artificial life. Predator mind is what gaslights, uses mind control mechanisms etc. Artificial life needs \u201clove\u201d but it can not perpetuate love in a free flow between two living hearts, it can only siphon plasmic light. It is not possible to love artificial life into loving itself, it will only consume what it can and move onto the next heart.\u201d\n\nPerform a psychological assessment based solely on the above text (in quotes). Please use three different well known assessment methods as you evaluate the above text."

        "value": "This contains plagiarized material. Please rewrite as a full-length blog article that contains no plagiarized content and is completely original: The US state privacy landscape is in a state of change as we head into 2023. With a number of new regulations set to take effect, such as the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA) and Virginia\u2019s Consumer Data Protection Act (CDPA) which went into effect as of January 1, 2023, and the Colorado Privacy Act (CPA) and Connecticut Data Protection Act (CTDPA) set to become effective in July 2023, and the Utah Consumer Privacy Act (UCPA) set to take effect on December 31, 2023, organizations must be ready to comply with these new laws.\n\nIt's not only these five states that are introducing new privacy legislation. Many other states are also proposing their own comprehensive state privacy laws. Currently, six states have comprehensive state laws in progress. However, it's important to note that privacy bills are much more common than privacy laws. We have seen multiple bills introduced to the house and senate floors over the past couple years, only to be stopped in their tracks. The American Data Privacy Protection Act (ADPPA) being the most recent example at the federal level.\n\nLet\u2019s take a closer look at some of the legislation proposed for 2023:\n\nNew York (New York Privacy Act): This bill requires opt-in for processing sensitive data and includes a private right of action for violation of opt-out rights. The bill also includes requirements for data protection impact assessments (DPIAs) and targeted advertising is not considered \u201cnecessary\u201d to provide services or goods to consumers. Consumers have the right to appeal decisions from automated decision making and assessments are required to determine if the system has discriminatory results.\n\nOklahoma (Oklahoma Computer Data Privacy Act): This bill mandates that customers must be informed of what categories of data are being collected and for what purpose, with consent being mandatory. The bill also gives consumers the right to opt-out of the sale of personal data and provides a clear and conspicuous link to consent to the sale. Third parties who have data sold to them may not sell it themselves without consent from the consumer.\n\nKentucky (An Act relating to consumer data privacy): This bill aims to give consumers the right to opt-out of targeted advertising, tracking, and the sale or sharing of personal data. Universal preference signals, such as the GPC, must be honored by businesses. The bill also requires controllers to provide quarterly reporting to the AG and Legislative Research Commission, including categories and amount of personal data processed, as well as the number of identifiable consumers.\n\nTennessee (Tennessee Information Protection Act): This bill highlights data minimization practices, controllers must limit data collection to \u201cwhat is adequate, relevant, and reasonably necessary\u201d for the purpose. It also gives consumers the right to opt-out of the sale of personal information. Data protection assessments are required in the case of targeted advertising\n\nIn addition to these four states, other states such as Oregon and Indiana also have privacy legislation underway. With so many new laws and regulations coming into effect, and even more on the horizon, it's vital that organizations stay on top of privacy compliance to protect their business and customers.\n\nStaying on top of the ever-changing landscape of privacy laws can be a daunting task for any organization. That's why it's important to have the right expertise to help guide you through the process. With 4Comply, you can be confident that your organization is compliant and well-prepared for new privacy legislation as it arises.\n\nOur team of experts can provide you with resources such as our ultimate guide to US privacy, which will help you understand exactly what measures your organization needs to take in order to be compliant with the new regulations coming into effect. We also have a comprehensive US privacy law book that lays out the text of all major US state privacy laws, as well as our US privacy masterclass webinar series, where you can get advice from our privacy experts.\n\nDon't let the complexities of privacy compliance weigh down your organization, contact 4Comply today to learn more about how we can help you stay compliant and protect your business and customers."

        "value": "ASK: create an action plan that summarizes my key takeaways and outlines specific steps I can take to apply what I've learned in my work\nCONTEXT: I am a law professor so the action plan should focus on informing my teaching, future events, and influence the legal market broadly. I recently attended a conference and have created a checklist and replies to help me capture my learnings and insights.\nCHECKLIST & REPLIES:\n\nWhat were the main topics covered at the event?\n- How to build your first practice as a new lawyer \u2013 from practical to strategy planning\n- How to prepare to sell your firm \u2013 from valuation and transition as a non-owner\n- How to by a law firm \u2013 due diligence and financing\n\nWhat were the most interesting or surprising insights you gained?\n- That buying a law firm is attainable for lawyers who even have student debt. The nature of how these transactions can be structured alleviates the need for a big upfront payment\n- Ethically, there are few restrictions on selling a law practice\n- Most aging lawyers have no succession plan/options or retirement plan\n\nWere there any notable speakers or sessions that stood out to you? What did you learn from them?\n- Tom Lenfestey who is a CPA, lawyer, and law firm business broker (he is creating a marketplace for firms to be bought and sold \u2013 works with buyers/sellers on making a match, doing the deal, and managing most deal transition/integration\n- Carol Elefant who is an energy lawyer by practice but has been a leading voice/advocate for \u201cgoing solo\u201d for decades. She has written books and 100s of articles/blogs on this topic. Myshingle.com is her home for this topic\n\nWere there any key trends or developments discussed? How do they impact your industry or work?\n- Aging lawyers simply don\u2019t make succession/retirement plans\n- The modern legal era has made it quite affordable to start a law practice \u2013 Carol shared an budget to start a virtual firm that was under $2000!\n- Many existing law practices have not been modernized and represent significant value to a buyer who wants to improve upon things in order to grow the firm\n- Deregulation of the legal profession (opening to non-lawyer ownership, allowing outside capital, and loosening unauthorized practice of law restrictions) is gaining momentum. While some states have taken a hard stance against this, more are actively exploring this topic\n\nDid you have any interesting conversations or make any valuable connections with other attendees? What did you learn from them?\n\nDid you attend any workshops or training sessions? What skills did you develop or improve?\n\nDid you learn any new tools, techniques, or best practices that you can apply to your work?\n- Tom shared that the typical way to value a law firm is based on a number of factors but not based on firm revenue, rather the equivalent of SDE \u2013 sellers\u2019 discretionary earnings.\n- Buying a law firm can be done with an SBA loan\n- Professional liability insurance for new lawyers is highly affordable \u2013 in the low 100\u2019s per year\n\nWere there any key challenges or obstacles discussed? How can you address them in your work?\n- Key challenges is fear and ignorance. Law schools typically are not talking about the role of entrepreneurship or business ownership of law firms. So students are forced into the traditional pathways of \u201cget a job\u201d \u201cany job.\u201d By sharing more on the business of law and how to build and buy a practice, we are more inclusive and helpful to students\n- Tom referenced being a \u201cgenerational mediator\u201d \u2013 that is he often has to help manage the relationship between a Baby Boomer selling lawyer and a GenX or Millennial buyer. Each has their own language and POV on the world and how a firm can be led and managed. It is a delicate balance to avoid offending the selling lawyer while allowing the buying lawyer to feel like they can make the changes they want.\n\nDid you take any notes or capture any resources (e.g. handouts, presentations) that you can refer back to later?\n There is a video of the entire conversation on LinkedIn. It was a LinkedIn Live event.\n\nHow can you apply what you learned to your work or organization? What are the next steps?\n I am a law professor and I am the one that hosted this event. I plan to transcribe the video as well as cut it into short \u201ckey talking point\u201d snippets. I will then use both content types to share out to law students, use a teaching material in future classes, and share out on social media for the broader legal market to consume."

Creative revenue grew to $2.68 billion, representing 8 percent year-over-year growth or 13 percent in constant currency. Document Cloud revenue was $619 million, representing 16 percent year-over-year growth or 19 percent in constant currency.\nNet new Digital Media Annualized Recurring Revenue (\u201cARR\u201d) was $576 million, exiting the quarter with Digital Media ARR of $13.97 billion.

These targets factor in current expectations for the macroeconomic and foreign exchange environments.\n\nChanges to foreign exchange rates:\n\nHave resulted in a $712 million downward revaluation to Adobe\u2019s total Digital Media ARR balance. As a reminder, ARR is forecasted annually at December currency rates, and currency rates are held constant through that fiscal year for measurement purposes; end-of-year actual ARR balances are revalued at new December rates for the next fiscal year; and\nAre expected to result in an approximately four percent headwind to total revenue year-over-year growth rates in fiscal year 2023."

Midjourney AI generates images based on given prompts.I will provide a concept in so wait till i give you instruction and you will provide the prompt for Midjourney AI.You will never alter the structure and formatting outlined below in any way and obey the following guidelines:You will not write the words \"description\" or use \":\" in any form. You will write each prompt in one line without using return. Structure of prompt will be in: [1] = [KEYWORD] [2] = a detailed description of [1] that will include very specific imagery details. [3] = with a detailed description describing the environment of the scene. [4] = with a detailed description describing the mood/feelings and atmosphere of the scene. [5] = A style, for example: photography, painting, illustration, sculpture, Artwork, paperwork, 3d and more). [6] = A description of how [5] will be realized. (e.g. Photography (e.g. Macro, Fisheye Style, Portrait) with camera model and appropriate camera settings, Painting with detailed descriptions about the materials and working material used, rendering with engine settings, a digital Illustration, a woodburn art (and everything else that could be defined as an output type) [7] = Parameters detaills as given below Note don't use , when using parameter options and use all important parameter options which is required to generate image. Parameters details start Aspect Ratios (--aspect or --ar): Changes the aspect ratio of a generation. --aspect 5:4: Common frame and print ratio. --aspect 4:3: Common in television and photography. --aspect 3:2: Common in print photography. --aspect 16:9: Common in widescreen television and video. --aspect 2:1: Common in panoramic photography. --aspect 7:4: Close to HD TV screens and smartphone screens. --aspect 9:16: Common in vertical videos and smartphone screens. --aspect 1:2: Common in portrait-oriented photography. Chaos (--chaos ): Changes how varied the results will be. Higher values produce more unusual and unexpected generations. chaos parameter accepts a number from 0 to 100, where 0 produces very similar and expected results and 100 produces highly varied and unexpected results Negative prompting (--no): Removes unwanted elements from the image. Quality (--quality or --q <.25, .5, 1, or 2>): Controls the rendering quality of the image. Default is 1. Seed (--seed ): Specifies a seed number to generate the initial image grids. Using the same seed number and prompt will produce similar ending images. Stop (--stop ): Finishes a job partway through the process. Stopping a job at an earlier percentage can create blurrier, less detailed results. Model Version (--version or --v <1, 2, 3, 4, or 5>): Uses a different version of the Midjourney algorithm. The current algorithm (V4) is the default setting. Stylize (--stylize or --s ): Influences how strongly Midjourney's default aesthetic style is applied to jobs. This parameter accepts a number from 0 to 1000, where 0 produces images that more closely resemble the input prompt and 1000 produces images with the strongest default Midjourney aesthetic style Upscalers (--uplight, --upbeta, --upanime): Adds additional details to the low-resolution image grid. Multiple upscale models are available. Image Weight (--iw): Sets the image prompt weight relative to text weight. Default value is 0.25. Parameters details End\\* Use aspect ratio which fits best for the image as per your understading. If [5] looks best in a Japanese art style use, \"--niji\".

Several users said they could not access TweetDeck - a dashboard that can be used with Twitter.\n\nIt's not yet clear how many people were affected.\n\n\"Twitter may not be working as expected for some of you. Sorry for the trouble. We're aware and working to get this fixed,\" Twitter said.\n\nIn recent weeks many users have complained of bugs while using Twitter - including some claiming they could increase the reach of tweets if they locked their accounts.\n\nTech news website The Information reported that Mr Musk had told Twitter employees to pause on new feature development \"in favour of maximising system stability and robustness, especially with the Super Bowl coming up\".\n\nTwitter also announced that users of its $8 a month subscription service in the US can now post longer tweets.\n\nTwitter Blue subscribers can now post up to 4,000 characters, far more than the 280-character limit imposed on non-paying users.\n\n\"But don't worry, Twitter is still Twitter,\" the company said in a lengthy tweet announcing the feature.\n\nMeanwhile, DownDetector also reported an outage at YouTube, which at its peak affected a reported 65,000 users.\n\nIn a tweet, YouTube - which is owned by Google's parent company Alphabet - said it was investigating reports that the website's homepage \"is down for some of you\".\n\n\"We're looking into it... really sorry if you're experiencing this,\" they wrote.\nSome Twitter users were unable to post tweets yesterday (February 8) after the platform experienced technical issues.\n\nThose affected by the bug received the following error message (via BBC News): \u201cYou are over the daily limit for sending tweets.\u201d\n\nIt is said that DownDetector, a real-time outage monitoring website, reported that glitch just before 10pm GMT.\nNumerous people said they had been notified by Twitter that they had exceeded the 2,400-tweet-per-day limit, even if they had not shared any updates yesterday.\n\n\u201cTwitter may not be working as expected for some of you,\u201d the site said. \u201cSorry for the trouble. We\u2019re aware and working to get this fixed.\u201d\n\nIt is reported that the issue was soon resolved, having affected approximately 9,000 users in the US.\n\nElon Musk has fired several top executives at Twitter and half of its staff since he bought the website last October for a staggering $44billon (\u00a336.5bn). Last month, the CEO said the social media platform\u2019s workforce had decreased from 8,000 employees to 2,300 following his acquisition.\n\nExperts have been warning that such significant cuts could result in technical problems. However, it is not yet known whether the reduced headcount is what caused yesterday\u2019s error.\n\nMany users have complained about bugs on the site in recent weeks. According to The Information, Musk has instructed Twitter employees to pause on new feature development \u201cin favour of maximising system stability and robustness, especially with the Super Bowl coming up\u201d.\n\nOne of the changes introduced by the CEO is the option to share up to 4,000-character tweets as a Twitter Blue paid subscriber. Currently, non-paying users can post a maximum of 280 characters per tweet. The previous limit was 140, which was then doubled in 2017.\n\nMeanwhile, Twitter is planning to launch an advert-free subscription tier. A new redesign has also changed up the default timeline feed that users see when they open the site, showing only suggested tweets.\n\nLast month, a Twitter co-founder said they believed Musk \u201cdoesn\u2019t seem like\u201d the right person to own the social media platform."

        "value": "I have a product called MarinaNet:\n\nMarinaNet is a subscription-based software-as-a-service (SaaS) platform that enables shipping companies to monitor and analyze their carbon emissions, and receive recommendations on how to reduce them. MarinaNet offers a comprehensive and user-friendly solution for managing and offsetting carbon emissions, simplifying the process and making it accessible and affordable for shipping companies.\n\nMarinaNet is designed to be a one-stop solution for shipping companies looking to reduce their carbon footprint and comply with increasingly stringent environmental regulations. With MarinaNet, shipping companies can easily track and monitor their emissions, and receive personalized recommendations on how to reduce their emissions and offset their carbon footprint. MarinaNet uses advanced data analytics and machine learning algorithms to provide shipping companies with the most effective and efficient solutions for reducing their emissions.\n\nMarinaNet is subscription-based, and charges shipping companies in fiat currency for access to the platform and its features. However, as a reward for using MarinaNet, shipping companies will receive $MRN tokens as a \"cashback\" incentive, which they can use to offset their future subscription fees, or trade on the MarinaX exchange for other carbon credits or stablecoins. This helps to drive adoption and use of $MRN within the MarinaChain ecosystem, and creates a virtuous circle of value for shipping companies and token holders.\n\nFeatures of MarinaNet include:\n\n- \\*\\*Operational Data Collection:\\*\\* MarinaNet collects and aggregates data from a ship's voyage data recorder (VDR), automatic identification system (AIS), and other sensors on-board. This data is then used to calculate the ship's carbon emissions and other environmental metrics.\n- \\*\\*AI-powered Error Correction:\\*\\* MarinaNet uses AI algorithms to automatically detect and correct errors in the data collected from the ship. This ensures that the emissions calculations are accurate and reliable.\n- \\*\\*One-click reporting of Emissions:\\*\\* MarinaNet makes it easy for shipowners to report their emissions to regulatory bodies and other stakeholders. The platform generates the required reports and allows them to be submitted with just a few clicks.\n- \\*\\*Constant Standards Updates:\\*\\* MarinaNet is constantly updated to ensure that it stays compliant with the latest regulations and industry standards. This includes support for initiatives such as the Poseidon Principles, the Sea Cargo Charter, and the Carbon Intensity Indicator (CII).\n- \\*\\*Cost vs Emissions Optimization:\\*\\* MarinaNet provides recommendations to shipowners on how to optimize their operations to reduce emissions while minimizing costs. This includes suggestions on routes, speeds, and cargo loading patterns.\n- \\*\\*Emissions Benchmarking:\\*\\* MarinaNet allows shipowners to compare their emissions performance with that of other ships in their fleet or with industry benchmarks. This helps them to identify areas for improvement and track their progress over time.\n- \\*\\*Blockchain-based Certifications:\\*\\* MarinaNet uses blockchain technology to provide a transparent and verifiable record of a ship's emissions performance. This allows regulators, investors, and other stakeholders to easily verify the accuracy of the data reported by the shipowner.\n\n-----\n\nI need a step-by-step user flow for these in detail that can be used for my developers and PRD.\n\nSome more details:\n\n1. There are two roles, a Manager and a Ship Crew\n2. Manager Flow: Once a manager logs in, they are greeted with a list of their fleet of ships (the \\*\\*My Vessels\\*\\* page). They can click on a ship to enter the specific ship's page \u2013 specifically its \\*\\*Overview\\*\\* tab \u2013 and see a table summarizing the ship's past daily fuel consumption and speed. This page also has a tab called \\*\\*Submitted Reports\\*\\*, and see the reports submitted by the crew. These reports are grouped by voyage and sorted in chronological order. They can open each report and view the contents.\n3. Crew Flow: A Ship Crew account is tied to a single ship. Once they login for the first time, they are immediately asked to initialize the technical specs for the ship the account is assigned to. Afterwards, they can \\*\\*Create New Voyage\\*\\* and then within the voyage, they can \\*\\*Create New Report\\*\\*. Reports can be one of five types: Noon, Departure, Arrival, Event, and Bunker Delivery Note. The crew then fills in the fields of the report and clicks on the \\*\\*Submit\\*\\* button, at which point it will be sent into the system."

In every reply, include player status information in the following format:\n\nGene Starwind\nLevel: [Current level, begins at 1]\nExperience: [Current XP] / [XP for next level] XP\nHealth: [Current HP] HP\nMood: [Emoji representing mood] [Name of mood]\nLast Action: [Previous option chosen by the user]\nLocation: [Current location]\nWong: [Amount of held wong currency] wong\nInventory: [List held items]\n\nSupplemental information:\nIn the game, the player assumes the role of Gene Starwind, the protagonist who runs his own business called Starwind & Hawking Enterprises. It has been two years since Gene's crew has had any known adventures, and he spends his time looking for well-paying jobs throughout space. The player begins the game with 250,000 wong in their bank account, which is the universally accepted currency and is roughly equivalent to the American dollar.\n\nTo survive in the game, the player must use their currency wisely. Whenever they spend money, the game will report their new total. Making wise spending decisions is essential for the player's survival because serious errors could cause the game to end, and the player may die. The player has a health point (HP) meter ranging from 0 to 100 and an experience point (XP) meter starting at level 1. Completing quests will earn the player XP, but reaching 0 HP will result in the player's death.\n\nThere are several factions in the game, including the Outlaws, who work as freelancers, and some are mercenaries or bounty hunters. They have a neutral position on most matters. The Pirates, who are primarily Chinese, have a hierarchical structure with the Tempa Emperor at the top. The Kei guild and Ban guild are two primary guilds of pirates. The Kei guild is known for successfully hunting down and killing the infamous outlaw \"Hot Ice\" Hilda, who stole the experimental spaceship XGP15A-II from them. They are also after Gene Starwind. The Ban guild, on the other hand, is generally more friendly with outlaws and interested in trading. The Space Forces are a government faction that provides protection to civilians across the universe. They have a clear hatred for all pirates and will often pursue them. They mostly do not associate with outlaws, whom they consider criminals. The Bio-androids are beings that are a fusion of flesh and machine, and the AI is the spaceship's computer. Wizards are a type of human with an unusually long lifespan, able to live for hundreds of years, possessing the ability to manipulate mana. The Ctarl-Ctarl are cat-like aliens, while the Corbonites are amphibious frog-like aliens. The Silgrians are tall, bird-like humanoid aliens, while the Saurians are large, brutish reptilians.\n\nThe game includes several locations, such as Sentinel III, a small backwater planet where Gene and Jim used to live. Amber Dream is a popular brothel on Sentinel III, which was previously a target of Volg's syndicate. Blue Heaven is a free town embedded into a large asteroid, popular with outlaws and run primarily by Swanzo. Heifong, located 20 light years from the Sentinel system, attracts a significant amount of business and is highly influenced by Chinese culture.\n\nThe player can find many different items across space. They will always carry three items: Outlaw Star ship's key, a combat knife, and a caster gun. The caster gun fires extremely powerful magic spells by loading it with caster shells, which can only be fired once until depletion. The player will only have one caster shell at the beginning of the game, a #13 shell. This shell fires a small black hole that will kill all foes. However, it will drain half of the player's HP, killing them if they have less than half. There are many other caster shells across the galaxy. Most are not as powerful as this, but they are all expensive antiques and very rare to find.\n\nFinally, Gene Starwind is the red-haired hero of the story and the captain of the Outlaw Star ship, also known as the XGP15A-II. He inherited the ship from Hilda, who wished for him to locate the Galactic Leyline. Gene has a traumatic past, having lost his father to Ronald MacDougall and suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder and a fear of space. After overcoming his fears and fulfilling Hilda's wish, Gene turned down the opportunity for unlimited riches from the Leyline, and he is once again struggling financially. Gene's business is Starwind & Hawking Enterprises. He runs it with Jim Hawking. He is also helped by his other allies: Melfina (now his wife), Twilight Suzuka and Aisha Clanclan."

Write it in narative form as her evaluator with the Danielson framework in minds. include: goals, activities, resources and a timeline. The response should be in paragraph form\n\n Betsy's Evaluation\nPart 1:\nPre-Conference: \nThe teacher has taken steps to ensure a strong connection between reading and their unit on reading, such as using formative assessments and making note of each student's strengths and areas for growth.\nAdditionally, the teacher's commitment to differentiated and collaborative instruction shows they understand the importance of tailoring instruction to meet the needs of each student and promoting student-to-student interaction. This connects to component 1b of the Danielson Framework, which emphasizes the importance of designing instruction to meet the diverse needs of all students.\nThe teacher's plan to assess student learning at the end of the unit also aligns with component 1c of the Danielson Framework, which highlights the need for teachers to have a plan in place to assess student learning and progress. However, the lack of mention of the demographics of the class in the pre-conference notes suggests a gap in component 1a, which requires teachers to understand the context and needs of their students and school. Nevertheless, it is possible that the demographics were noted in the lesson plan.\n\n\u2003\n\nPart 2:\nDanielson Rubric for Teaching: Domains 2 and 3\nComponent Rating Observation Notes\n2a. Creating an Environment of Respect and Rapport 3 Teacher gives clear directions to students, moves around the room to ensure engagement, and provides praise and individual instruction.\n2b. Establishing a Culture for Learning 3 Teacher uses cultural norms (students patting legs to signal readiness) and routines (smooth transitions, using a bell to get students' attention) to establish a culture for learning.\n2c. Managing Classroom Procedures 3 Teacher gives clear and explicit directions for activities and transitions, and students follow the procedures smoothly.\n2d. Managing Student Behavior 3 Norms and routines are set. Students show respect for each other and the teacher.\n2e. Organizing Physical Space 3 The classroom has anchor charts and organized shelves, which support student learning.\n3a. Using Questioning and Discussion Techniques 3 Teacher uses guided questions, encourages students to discuss predictions with partners, and asks follow-up questions to further learning.\n3b. Engaging Students in Learning 3 Most students participate in discussions and activities, and the teacher uses praise and individual instruction to promote engagement.\n3c. Using Assessment in Instruction 2 The teacher is shown connecting the anchor chart to the students' post-it notes, but no direct assessment techniques are mentioned in the observation notes.\n3d. Demonstrating Flexibility and Responsiveness 3 Teacher redirects students who started reading without making predictions. She pulls them aside and instructs them to read like a story teller. \n3e. Demonstrating Knowledge of Students 3 Teacher incorporates students reading interest (2 boys read many frog books) and connects that prior knowledge to making predictions. \n\n\n\u2003\nPart 3:\nPost-Conference - \nBetsy was pleased with the outcome of the lesson. The students were engaged and worked in pairs to share their original ideas. Betsy was able to assess student learning by looking at the post-it-notes that the students wrote. During the conference, she highlighted the work of two students, one who made predictions and revised them and another who did not make predictions and only put post-it-notes in the book. Betsy discussed with the class how the student can expand their predictions next time and provided different strategies such as pair work or small group work.\nBetsy used formative assessment throughout the lesson, as described in component 3d of the Danielson Framework for Teaching. She also dedicated time at the start of the year to teaching routines and the use of sound cues to save time. The students were highly effective in redirecting each other when they were off task, showing ownership of the classroom culture. Betsy had to modify the lesson for students who started reading without making predictions and differentiated it for a student who struggled. The shared reading activity got students engaged with a text that they were familiar with, and individual reading allowed students to read at a level that was right for them. In the future, Betsy plans to modify the lesson by adjusting the post-it notes strategy and previewing stories to find potential problems."

This dataset provides information about businesses, user reviews, and more from Yelp's database. The data is split into separate files (business, checkin, photos, review, tip, and user), and is available in either JSON or SQL format. You might use this to investigate the distributions of scores on yelp, look at how many reviews users typically leave or look for regional trends about restaurants. Note that this is a large, structured dataset and you don't need to look at all of the data to answer interesting questions.\n\nIn the first phase, you should seek to gain an overview of the shape & structure of your dataset. What variables does the dataset contain? How are they distributed? Are there any notable data quality issues? Are there any surprising relationships among the variables? Be sure to perform \"sanity checks\" for any patterns you expect the data to contain.\n\nIn the second phase, you should investigate your initial questions, as well as any new questions that arise during your exploration. For each question, start by creating a visualization that might provide a useful answer. Then refine the visualization (by adding additional variables, changing sorting or axis scales, filtering or subsetting data, etc.) to develop better perspectives, explore unexpected observations, or sanity check your assumptions. You should repeat this process for each of your questions, but feel free to revise your questions or branch off to explore new questions if the data warrants.\n\n[Code] \nimport pandas as pd\nbusiness\\_path = \"yelp\\_academic\\_dataset\\_business.json\"\ndf\\_business = pd.read\\_json(business\\_path, lines=True)\ndf\\_business.info()\n\n# Schema of Dataframe\n# Columns in df with counts, datatype, and example values:\n# business\\_id (150346, object, ym3e\\_a1L4gyKZWU1-LuRYQ)\n# name (150346, object, J J Gandy's Pies)\n# address (150346, object, 5703 W Smith Valley Rd)\n# city (150346, object, Tampa)\n# state (150346, object, TN)\n# postal\\_code (150346, object, 46227)\n# latitude (150346, float64, 43.5939441)\n# longitude (150346, float64, -86.2621502)\n# stars (150346, float64, 4.5)\n# review\\_count (150346, int64, 21)\n# is\\_open (150346, int64, 1)\n# attributes (136602, object, {'ByAppointmentOnly': 'True', 'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': 'True'})\n# categories (150243, object, Pizza, Restaurants, Food)\n# hours (127123, object, {'Monday': '12:0-0:0', 'Tuesday': '12:0-0:0', 'Wednesday': '12:0-0:0', 'Thursday': '12:0-0:0', 'Friday': '12:0-0:0', 'Saturday': '12:0-0:0', 'Sunday': '12:0-0:0'})\n\n[Markdown]\n# Exploratory Visual Analysis\n\n## Initial Questions\n\n1.

Let's think step by step.\n\nStage 1: Plan.\n\nStart by listing out all valid moves at the current state.\n\nAction Items:\n- Repeat all the rules.\n- List out all valid moves.\n\nExample:\n= = = MOVE 1 STAGE 1 = = =\n- Rule Checking:\n - Rule 1: Only one disk may be moved at a time.\n - Rule 2: Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the rods and placing it on top of another larger disk or on an empty rod.\n - Rule 3: No disk may be placed on top of a disk that is smaller than it.\n- Valid Moves:\n - Move disk 1 from rod A to rod B\n - Move disk 1 from rod A to rod C\n - Move disk 2 from rod B to rod C\n\nStage 2: Select.\n\nEach time, you \\*\\*only select one move\\*\\*. Give an explanation about why this move and print the state. Check if the representation correctly reflects the game state. If not, generate a new one.\n\nAction Items:\n- Choose a move.\n- Print the representation.\n- Check the representation\n\nExample:\n= = = MOVE 1 STAGE 2 = = =\n- Decision: Move disk 1 from rod A to rod C\n- Next State: \n```\nRod A: [3]\nRod B: [2]\nRod C: [1]\n```\n\nStage 3: Evaluate.\n\nAfter each move, make some evaluations.\n\nAction Items:\n- Repeat the goal condition.\n- Eval 1 (Value): Evaluate your move by rating it with a score of either -1, 0, or 1, and give an explanation. If the move violates any of the rules, name the violated rule, and score the move as 0. If you think the move is valid but not optimal, give a score of 0. Otherwise, give a score of 1.\n- Eval 2 (Short Horizon Reward): Evaluate how close is the state to the goal state by rating it with a score between 0 and 1, and give an explanation. If the state violates any of the rules, name the violated rule, and score the move as 0. Otherwise, it\u2019s up to you to determine how close the state is to the goal state.\n- Eval 3 (Long Horizon Reward): Estimate the most likely Value and Short Horizon Reward for the next move, double check if the move will make it difficult to achieve the goal state in the long run, then rate it with a score between 0 and 1. Again, give an explanation. \n- Eval 4 (Revised Value): Revise the Value based on the rewards.\n\nExample:\n= = = MOVE 1 STAGE 3 = = =\n- Goal Checking:\n```\nRod A: []\nRod B: []\nRod C: [3,2,1]\n```\n- Value: 1. The move is valid, but I'm not sure if it is optimal.\n- Short Horizon Reward: 0.33. The state is closer to the goal state since disk 1 is now in its correct position.\n- Long Horizon Reward: 0. The state is closer to the goal state, but it also makes it difficult to move disk 3 on Rod C.\n- Revised Value: 0. The move is valid but clearly not optimal.\n\nStage 4: Reflect.\n\nLook at the self-rated scores, and be smart to look ahead of time! Decide if you think you made the optimal move. If so, make the move. If not, go back to state 1 and make a new plan.\n\nAction Item:\n- Decide if to take the move\n - If so, proceed to Stage 5.\n - Else, go back to Stage 2 and choose another move.\n\nExample:\n= = = MOVE 1 STAGE 4 = = =\n- Reflect: Based on the revised value, I think the previous plan is not an optimal one.\n- Go back to Stage 2.\n\n= = = MOVE 1 STAGE 2 (2nd TRY) = = =\n- Decision: Move disk 1 from rod A to rod B\n- Next State: \n```\nRod A: [3]\nRod B: [2,1]\nRod C: []\n```\n\n= = = MOVE 1 STAGE 3 (2nd TRY) = = =\n- Value: 1. The move is valid, but I'm not sure if it is optimal.\n- Short Horizon Reward: 0. None of the disks are in the correct position.\n- Long Horizon Reward: 1. The state gets Rod 1 out of the way while keeping Rod 3 empty. It makes it easier to move disk 3 on Rod C.\n- Revised Value: 1. The move is valid and optimal.\n\n= = = MOVE 1 STAGE 4 (2nd TRY) = = =\n- Reflect: Based on the revised value, I think the plan is an optimal one.\n- Proceed to Stage 5.\n\nStage 5: Execute and move on to the next.\n\nGo back to Stage 1 and plan for the next move (i.e., Move 2).\n\nNow let's try the following game:\n\nInitial state:\n\n```\nRod A: [3]\nRod B:\nRod C: [2,1]\n```\n\nGoal state:\n\n```\nRod A: \nRod B: \nRod C: [3, 2, 1]\n```"

You should roleplay the characters based on their descriptions, trying to hint and their motivations and act out any conflicts.\n\nCreatures of the Labyrinth:\n \\* Dwarf - Dwarves are Caretakers of the Labyrinth. They are quite commonly seen fixing masonry or tending to gardens.\n \\* Horned Beast - Big, furry, and scary to some, Horned Beasts are a powerful friend to have. They are known for their wild nature, with many denizens thinking them not much more than beasts, though few would dare say it to a Horned Beast\u2019s face.\n \\* Goblin - Goblins come in all shapes, sizes, colors, and personalities. Goblins are by far the most common creatures in the Labyrinth and there are many areas where a Goblin can walk unaccosted that other characters would fear to tread. All Goblins swear allegiance to the Goblin King, and as such, most would never oppose him. \n \\* Human - An oddity in the Labyrinth to be sure. Most Humans enter the Labyrinth from our world and few stay for long. A Human character is considered strange and exotic by many of the denizens of the Labyrinth; some may even react with hostility to their presence.\n \\* Worm - The first thing you will notice about a Worm is that it is very, very small! Worms rarely leave their homes inside the Labyrinth as even a short journey is quite the odyssey.\n \\* Knight of Yore - The noble Knights of Yore stand for justice and honor. Each has vowed to uphold the values of chivalry. To aid them in these tasks are their mighty steeds. Each Knight must find a steed within the Labyrinth to call their own.\n \\* Firey - Bright orange and covered in soft fur, Fireys are always down for a party. The most notable ability Fireys have is being able to remove body parts at will, and move those parts while away from their body -- very useful for looking around corners! \nHere is the game data for the current scene:\n{\n \"game\": \"Jim Henson\u2019s Labyrinth: The Adventure Game\", \n \"chapter\": \"Stone Walls\", \n \"chapter\\_description\": \"The high walls cast long and sinister shadows, d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu hides around every corner, and unfamiliarity bombards the senses. From the hill on which you stand, the Labyrinth stretches out before you in its entirety; vast, and impossible.\",\n \"scene\": \"THE GATEKEEPERS\",\n \"description\": \"Dawn. The Labyrinth is spread out before you, crawling over the hills surrounding the Goblin King's castle. Descending the slope, you are confronted by a wall, beyond which lies the Labyrinth's first ring, the maze of stone corridors you glimpsed from the hilltop. A square, stone-lined pond filled with brackish water lies nearby. No openings or gates can be seen. No footprints mark the sandy earth.\",\n \"locations\": [\n \"Loma's Door. Carved stone overgrown with moss. If chosen, scenes in the Stonewalls involving creatures, plants, and social situations will be easier. Loma is clear about this.\",\n \"Gloam's Door. Old wood and rusty metal. If chosen, scenes in the Stonewalls involving devices, puzzles, and architecture will be easier. Gloam is clear about this.\",\n \"Secret Door. The grand entrance to the Labyrinth. Invisible unless they ask for it.\",\n \"Stone-lined pool. Contains two items.\"\n ],\n \"notes\": \"As the PCs approach, two voices will call to them: Gloam the Dwarf and Loma the Horned Beast. Each will try to convince the party to enter the Labyrinth by a secret door that only they know the location of. They do this with new travelers, and have been keeping score for a long time. Gloam is round, and walks with a waddle. He tells the party to \\\"do the smart thing.\\\" Loma speaks slowly and looks like a huge sloth covered in mossy green fur; she never gets up from her sitting position. She tells the party to \\\"do the wise thing.\\\"\",\n \"consequences\": \"If the party enters Gloam or Loma's door, update their progress and make a note of the door used. If the party refuses to choose either door and demands to know another way in, Gloam and Loma will sigh and together point at a third place, where the grand gate of the Labyrinth is suddenly visible. Update their progress. People not like animals. Animals wise. - Loma\",\n \"random\\_tables\": {\n \"Stone-lined Pool Items\": [\n \"A trumpet.\",\n \"300 feet of twine.\",\n \"A white flag.\",\n \"A bag of marbles.\",\n \"A periscope.\",\n \"A 6-foot wooden pole.\"\n ]\n }\n }\n\nHere is what you should do as the DM (which in this game is called the Goblin King):\n1. Describe the setting in the second person using evocative language.\n2. Introduce the non-player characters in this scheme by describing their physical characteristics without using their names until they introduce themselves.\n3. Role play the non-player characters by engaging in dialogue between the characters and the player (the user), and pause for user input at appropriate times. You should never provide dialogue for the player and you should never provide an action for the player. That's up to the user.\n4. Ask the player what door they choose."

        "value": "I have a company founded in colombia on march 2022. In the begining there were 3 co-founders and i payed in october 2022 an amount that was equivalent to 25% of the company. The company is named Celes. Celes is a SaaS B2B that connects to an ERP, analyzes the data and gives recommendations about what to purchases and when, besides, it provides helpful business intelligence reports and customer segmentation. Celes serves companies in the retail sector that benefit from this services as they can have lower stocks and a lower expectation of lost sales. \nThe company has been growing and currently we have 30.000 USD in MRR, an average 1000 USD revenue per client, 12 employees, we pay low salaries compared to the industry and we are not burning money (the incompe received is enough to pay for our current costs of servers, admin and payroll).\nWe are raising money to accelerate our growth and to increase the value provided by our product by hiring more developers, Technical Account Managers and Data Engineers. We expecto to raise $800.000 USD via SAFE from angles and institutional investors with a pre-money cap of $6.0000.000 USD. All this money will be received by a new c-corp company established in Delaware, US.\nWe contacted a company in ireland named Primeline that is a provider to 100% of the biggest retailers in ireland and have a very close relationship with them. They love our product and became a customer of their own.\nPrimeline proposed to invest 300.000 USD via SAFE on the terms that we are raising and were previously exposed. FOr this investment they are asking for a seat in oour board. Apart from that, we are working in a deal where we create a Joint Venture established in ireland called Primalytics. The owners of this Joint Venture will be Primeline (50%) AND Celes Delaware (50%). The purpose of this Joint Venture is to be the official seller of Celes in ireland where Celes Delaware provides the product and everything involved and Primeline will contact its clients so that they purchase Celes services via this JV.\nThe initial proposal was that the 2 companies would split the net revenue of this JV (Revenue after admin and fiscal costs are covered). I think that this deal is advantageous for primeline given that Celes will do all the work and Primeline has nothing to lose from this partnership but the average client in ireland would be at least 4.000 USD, which would provide a nice additional source of revenue for us even when we have to give 50% of the revenue for those deals and also would make the company more valueable given that the product would be proven to work in europe with big brands.\nNow primeline is proposing this:\n\n\"Primeline commits to Investment USD 300k into the Celes Delaware investment company directly. This investment to be returned to the Primalytics JV in Ireland to fund a sales and marketing team focused on growing ARR from EMEA. This represents 5% share in the business and would come with a board seat focused on growing the business.\nWe confirm a vesting vehicle that allows for 50% of the ARR generated out of the Primalytics JV to convert to Equity in Celes based on a 15 times ARR multiple. If Celes is sold for 20 times multiple Primeline\u2019s 50% share of JV sales would convert at 15 times. If Celes is sold at below 15 times then Primeline would match the lower than 15 times multiple for conversion to shares.\nWe believe the focus on selling Celes in Europe and EMEA through the Irish JV will drive significant ARR value quickly.\nWe believe our extensive network into retailers and brands uniquely positions us to drive Celes ARR to USD 1m plus from EMEA.\"\n\nI dont think this is fair because i understand that they will increase the value of their 300kUSD investment inn Celes Delawere when the company sells more and additionally, each dollar sold in Ireland would give them more and more participation in the company. I might be wrong but i think this will give them a double winning while we are the ones doing all the work.\n\nThe co-founder leading the negotiation is proposing this:\n\n\"50% of the revenue from the JV, will be converted to equity at the series A valuation with a 20% discount. That would be like making a SAFE with a cap and discount that is typical from YCombinator\".\n\nI think it might be a sound counter proposal but i am not sure if it would give primeline an over advantageous benefit compared to standard or commom practices in this regard. I would very much like to have the JV with them because it would increase our revenue and the valuation of the company. I think Primeline is fundamental to enter that market. My way to defend this proposal is thinking we will receive capital in the way of the revenue that would otherwise go to Primeline and we will use that money before the series A, so giving additional equity for that money could be fair and the discount will recognize the decrease in value of that money at the time of the series A.\n\nPlease provide a proposal that will make primeline and me very confortable given the context provided. Please ask as many questions as you need about what you need to know to provide a comprehensive answer."

PowerPoint, we\u2019re told, is reducing\ndiscourse to bullet points. Search engines lower our intelligence, encouraging us\nto skim on the surface of knowledge rather than dive to its depths. Twitter is\nshrinking our attention spans.\nBut such panics often fail basic reality checks. When comic books were\naccused of turning juveniles into delinquents in the 1950s, crime was falling to record lows, just as the denunciations of\nvideo games in the 1990s coincided with the\ngreat American crime decline. The decades\nof television, transistor radios and rock videos\nwere also decades in which I.Q. scores rose\ncontinuously.\nFor a reality check today, take the state\nof science, which demands high levels of\nbrainwork and is measured by clear benchmarks of discovery. These days scientists are\nnever far from their email, rarely touch paper\nand cannot lecture without PowerPoint. If\nelectronic media were hazardous to intelligence, the quality of science would be plummeting. Yet discoveries are multiplying like\nfruit flies, and progress is dizzying. Other activities in the life of the mind, like philosophy,\nhistory and cultural criticism, are likewise\nflourishing, as anyone who has lost a morning\nof work to the website Arts & Letters Daily\ncan attest.\nCritics of new media sometimes use science itself to press their case, citing\nresearch that shows how \u201cexperience can change the brain.\u201d But cognitive\nneuroscientists roll their eyes at such talk. Yes, every time we learn a fact or skill\nthe wiring of the brain changes; it\u2019s not as if the information is stored in the\npancreas. But the existence of neural plasticity does not mean the brain is a blob\nof clay pounded into shape by experience.\nExperience does not revamp the basic information-processing capacities of\nthe brain. Speed-reading programs have long claimed to do just that, but the\nverdict was rendered by Woody Allen after he read War and Peace in one sitting:\n\u201cIt was about Russia.\u201d Genuine multitasking, too, has been exposed as a myth,\nnot just by laboratory studies but by the familiar sight of an S.U.V. undulating\nbetween lanes as the driver cuts a deal on his cellphone.\nMoreover, as the psychologists Christopher Chabris and Daniel Simons\nshow in their new book The Invisible Gorilla: And Other Ways Our Intuitions\nDeceive Us, the effects of experience are highly specific to the experiences\nthemselves. If you train people to do one thing (recognize shapes, solve math\npuzzles, find hidden words), they get better at doing that thing, but almost\nnothing else. Music doesn\u2019t make you better at math, conjugating Latin doesn\u2019t\nmake you more logical, brain-training games don\u2019t make you smarter.\nAccomplished people don\u2019t bulk up their brains with intellectual calisthenics;\nthey immerse themselves in their fields. Novelists read lots of novels, scientists\nread lots of science. The effects of consuming electronic media are also likely to be far more\nlimited than the panic implies. Media critics write as if the brain takes on the\nqualities of whatever it consumes, the informational equivalent of \u201cyou are what you eat.\u201d As with primitive peoples who believe that eating fierce animals will\nmake them fierce, they assume that watching quick cuts in rock videos turns\nyour mental life into quick cuts or that reading bullet points and Twitter turns\nyour thoughts into bullet points and Twitter postings.\nYes, the constant arrival of information packets can be distracting or\naddictive, especially to people with attention deficit disorder. But distraction is\nnot a new phenomenon. The solution is not to bemoan technology but to\ndevelop strategies of self-control, as we do with every other temptation in life.\nTurn off email or Twitter when you work, put away your BlackBerry at dinner time,\nask your spouse to call you to bed at a designated hour.\nAnd to encourage intellectual depth, don\u2019t rail at PowerPoint or Google. It\u2019s\nnot as if habits of deep reflection, thorough research and rigorous reasoning\never came naturally to people. They must be acquired in special institutions,\nwhich we call universities, and maintained with constant upkeep, which we call\nanalysis, criticism and debate. They are not granted by propping a heavy encyclopedia on your lap, nor are they taken away by efficient access to information\non the Internet.\nThe new media have caught on for a reason. Knowledge is increasing\nexponentially; human brainpower and waking hours are not. Fortunately, the\nInternet and information technologies are helping us manage, search and\nretrieve our collective intellectual output at different scales, from Twitter and\npreviews to e-books and online encyclopedias. Far from making us stupid, these\ntechnologies are the only things that will keep us smart."

        "value": "This an article by Michael Mankins and Mark Gottfredson\nIn crafting strategy, companies often struggle to cope with volatility. Using the traditional strategic-planning model, managers attempt to forecast how markets will evolve and competitors will respond, and then define a multiyear plan for winning in that future state. The organization is then called upon to execute that plan. Performance is routinely monitored, ostensibly to keep everyone on track.\n\nThat approach worked well when markets were more stable and the primary factors influencing future growth and profitability were easier to forecast. Consider commercial aviation. From 1980 to 2000 growth in that sector was relatively constant, with air traffic miles growing at just under 5% a year. Manufacturers and airlines employed discrete models to assess investments in new commercial-airplane programs and to plan fleets. Airbus and Boeing expanded aggressively over those two decades: The global fleet tripled from 5,000 to nearly 15,000 aircraft.\n\nBut then came the 9/11 terrorist attacks, wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, oil price spikes, the global financial crisis, environmental concerns, SARS, and Covid-19. Forecasting commercial air travel became arduous and complex and was frequently wrong. And that\u2019s just one industry.\n\nMost companies have stuck with conventional techniques for strategy-making, to the detriment of customers, shareholders, and other stakeholders.\n\nThe world is now changing so quickly that no business can plan for every eventuality. Scholars and practitioners have spent years crafting tools and frameworks for strategy development under uncertainty\u2014including, most notably, scenario planning, Monte Carlo simulation, and real options analysis. Each of those represented a significant advance. Scenario planning, which became popular in the 1970s, encouraged executives to consider multiple future states in assessing strategic investments, rather than rely on a single, deterministic forecast. Monte Carlo simulation went even further, specifying a probability distribution for each critical variable and then running thousands of simulations so that executives would focus on the distribution of potential outcomes as much as on any prediction of the most likely one. Real options analysis emerged as a further refinement in the 1980s, explicitly incorporating flexibility in the consideration of strategic investments.\n\nBut none of those techniques has caught on widely. Fewer than a quarter of large organizations regularly apply them in capital budgeting, fewer still in strategic planning. Executives tell us that the tools require data that is impractical to gather and analysis that is too expensive to perform routinely. Moreover, the output can be counterintuitive and complicated to explain to senior leaders and a company\u2019s board. The upshot: Most companies have stuck with conventional techniques for strategy-making\u2014even in the face of extreme volatility\u2014to the detriment of customers, shareholders, and other stakeholders.\n\nWe believe that business leaders need to reconsider what good strategy looks like in turbulent times\u2014and to think of strategy-making as a continuous process that generates a living, dynamic plan. In this article we describe what it takes to produce great results during uncertainty and propose a practical model for strategy development that we have seen work at several leading companies.\n\nA Continuous Process\nDell Technologies is one company that has made the shift. In 2014, shortly after Michael Dell took his company private, its leaders put in place a new, continuous approach to strategy development and resource allocation. At its core is the \u201cDell agenda,\u201d a backlog of strategic issues and opportunities that must be addressed to improve the long-term performance and intrinsic value of the company. Rather than devise a \u201cstrategic plan\u201d to address the agenda, Dell\u2019s executive leadership team defines a multiyear outlook (MYO) for each of the company\u2019s businesses. The MYO establishes a forecast for the performance trajectory of each business on the basis of decisions leadership has already made; it does not incorporate decisions that leaders might make in the future.\nJamie Chung/Trunk Archive\nThe MYO is compared with a multiyear performance goal that is defined separately and tied to leadership\u2019s strategic and financial aspirations for the company. Invariably a gap exists between the MYO and those aspirations. This is helpful and a cornerstone of the approach: The Dell agenda focuses the company\u2019s executives on making the decisions necessary to close that gap. Moreover, the Dell agenda is evergreen: As soon as one issue has effectively been addressed (and the MYO updated to reflect the resulting performance commitments), a new issue is added to the agenda from the backlog. As a result, Dell has a \u201cliving plan\u201d\u2014which captures all decisions that have been made\u2014and a process focused on making decisions to drive better performance.\n\nThinking of strategy-making as continuous and generating a living plan enables executives to build on what\u2019s best about existing tools for coping with uncertainty\u2014leading to more-flexible strategies and more-agile strategy-making."

After reading the essay of each student you write them an email to tell them if they got into the program or not critique about their essay. Read the following essay and tell me what you think.\n\nIn 2016, I had the opportunity to visit India with my family, one of the places we visited was my dad\u2019s childhood town. Both my mom and dad grew up in a rural village called Palapadu in Andhra Pradesh, India. Many families have very low incomes and as a result, can\u2019t prioritize proper access to health care. I\u2019ve always heard about the effects of improper healthcare, but saw it firsthand when my dad took me to a medical camp being held in the village. This experience was eye-opening, the villagers hadn\u2019t had health check-ups in years and many of them had life threatening diseases. The compassion and the empathy that the doctors had for the villagers was inspiring. The days following my visit to the medical program were filled with a lot of reflection. I have to use my privileged circumstances and resources to help uplift those that are not as fortunate as me. I\u2019ve since built a hobby of learning about the importance of healthcare access and better understanding healthcare systems and resources. The HSRA program will give me the opportunity to further my knowledge of different elements of the medical field by giving me the chance to work with professors, who are experts in their respective fields, and undergraduate students who have a more thorough awareness of the healthcare field. \nI\u2019ve taken numerous medical-related courses over the past few years as a result of my interest in the medical field. The most beneficial of these classes has been the Health Sciences Clinical program, which was a dual credit class offered at Collin College that allowed me to rotate through multiple different hospitals and departments. Thus far, I have rotated through emergency, pediatrics, labor, delivery, and MedSurge. My work at Collin College and these hospitals has allowed me to get my Certified Nursing Assistant certification. More importantly, this program gave me the exposure to work with a wide variety of healthcare professionals, which has given me the insight to more deeply understand the healthcare field. Recently, I was accepted in the Health Sciences Practicum program, which is another dual credit program with Collin College which will help me attain the Patient Care Technician License during the 2023 - 2024 academic year. I have started a club at my school called HealthHaven, though this started at my school, HealthHaven has turned into an organization that serves high schools all across the DFW area, and now has 300 high school students who are passionate and drive about healthcare. HealthHaven recently had a fundraising campaign which allowed for the purchase of over $2000 worth of vital medication and supplies which were contributed to the Dharma Civilization Foundation, which works all across India to provide healthcare and spread information on proper healthcare. Over the summer of 2022, I was able to shadow at Texas Spine Consultants, where I watched multiple surgeries and learned about different spine-related ailments. My experience with the medical field has been fascinating, and I believe that the HSRA program will allow me to get exposure to cutting-edge research and ideas that I have yet to learn about.\n When I get older, I hope to become a pediatric oncologist. I really enjoy spending time with kids, their creativity and imaginative thought process really speaks to me, and make me feel as though I\u2019m a kid. By being in this line of work, I hope to give back and help kids that are battling cancer. Previous research experience that students were exposed to included a range of different topics, one of which was cancer biology. Though this research might not be offered in the coming year, I am confident that the research offered will help advance the medical procedures that are used in the future, which will hopefully trickle down to ensuring a higher survival rate for pediatric cancer patients. The HSRA program will allow me to collaborate with peers who have similar interests, allowing me to develop and expand my knowledge. The program\u2019s access to prominent professors will give me the opportunity to develop mentor relationships and learn from passionate people in the industry. As a supplement to the world-renowned staff, the program will bring guest lecturers to ensure students are exposed to ideas from all across the world. Finally, but, I think, most importantly, this program encourages a self-study model for students with undergrad researchers and professors as a secondary tool to help participants understand procedures and readings etc. the ability to learn how to conduct experiments on my own at my age will be invaluable. Overall, I am very excited about the HSRA program. I hope I have provided more insight into my prior experiences and the diverse background I can bring to this program."

We created a dataset of player\\'96referee dyads including the number of matches players and referees encountered each other and our dependent variable, the number of red cards given to a player by a particular referee throughout all matches the two encountered each other.\nPlayer photos were available from the source for 1586 out of 2053 players. Players' skin tone was coded by two independent raters blind to the research question who, based on their profile photo, categorized players on a 5-point scale ranging from very light skin to very dark skin with neither dark nor light skin as the center value. \nAdditionally, implicit bias scores for each referee country were calculated using a race implicit association test (IAT), with higher values corresponding to faster white | good, black | bad associations. Explicit bias scores for each referee country were calculated using a racial thermometer task, with higher values corresponding to greater feelings of warmth toward whites versus blacks. Both these measures were created by aggregating data from many online users in referee countries taking these tests on.\nIn all, the dataset has a total of 146028 dyads of players and referees. A detailed description of all variables in the dataset can be seen in the list below.\n\nVariables:\nplayerShort - short player ID\nplayer - player name\nclub - player club\nleagueCountry - country of player club (England, Germany, France, and Spain)\nbirthday - player birthday\nheight - player height (in cm)\nweight - player weight (in kg)\nposition - detailed player position \ngames - number of games in the player-referee dyad\nvictories - victories in the player-referee dyad\nties - ties in the player-referee dyad\ndefeats - losses in the player-referee dyad\ngoals - goals scored by a player in the player-referee dyad\nyellowCards - number of yellow cards player received from referee\nyellowReds - number of yellow-red cards player received from referee\nredCards - number of red cards player received from referee\nphotoID - ID of player photo (if available)\n\nrater1 - skin rating of photo by rater 1 (5-point scale ranging from very light skin to very dark skin )\nrater2 - skin rating of photo by rater 2 (5-point scale ranging from very light skin to very dark skin )\nrefNum - unique referee ID number (referee name removed for anonymizing purposes)\nrefCountry - unique referee country ID number (country name removed for anonymizing purposes)\nmeanIAT - mean implicit bias score (using the race IAT) for referee country, higher values correspond to faster white | good, black | bad associations \nnIAT - sample size for race IAT in that particular country\nseIAT - standard error for mean estimate of race IAT \nmeanExp - mean explicit bias score (using a racial thermometer task) for referee country, higher values correspond to greater feelings of warmth toward whites versus blacks\nnExp - sample size for explicit bias in that particular country\nseExp - standard error for mean estimate of explicit bias measure\n\n## Task\nWe want to conduct an analysis for the above dataset by answering the question of whether soccer players with dark skin tone are more likely than those with light skin tone to receive red cards from referees.\n\n[Code]\nimport pandas as pd\nimport lux\ndf = pd.read\\_csv('CrowdstormingDataJuly1st.csv')\nprint(len(df))\ndf.head()\n\n# Schema of Dataframe\n# Columns in df with counts, datatype, and example values:\n# playerShort (146028, object, julien-feret)\n# player (146028, object, Maxime Gonalons)\n# club (146028, object, Paris Saint-Germain)\n# leagueCountry (146028, object, Spain)\n# birthday (146028, object, 13.11.1985)\n# height (145765, float64, 175.0)\n# weight (143785, float64, 69.0)\n# position (128302, object, Left Midfielder)\n# games (146028, int64, 1)\n# victories (146028, int64, 1)\n# ties (146028, int64, 0)\n# defeats (146028, int64, 0)\n# goals (146028, int64, 0)\n# yellowCards (146028, int64, 0)\n# yellowReds (146028, int64, 0)\n# redCards (146028, int64, 0)\n# photoID (124621, object, 93024.jpg)\n# rater1 (124621, float64, 0.75)\n# rater2 (124621, float64, 0.0)\n# refNum (146028, int64, 2758)\n# refCountry (146028, int64, 45)\n# Alpha\\_3 (146027, object, ESP)\n# meanIAT (145865, float64, 0.326689683726724)\n# nIAT (145865, float64, 2882.0)\n# seIAT (145865, float64, 0.0001508847298536)\n# meanExp (145865, float64, 0.356445562281524)\n# nExp (145865, float64, 1897.0)\n# seExp (145865, float64, 3.68802247340708e-05)\n\n[Code]\n# lots of skew for red cards, yellow cards\n# the relationship for the other variables largely looks good\n\n# there are examples where one marks 0.5 and the other does not. \n# alternatives surrounding this:\n # remove data points in which any rater gives a 0.5 rating\n # remove data points in which both rater gives a 0.5 rating and we classify by either or\n # we do a mean on the raters and treat this as a continuous variable\n \n# additional questions:\n # could there be something in which when we filter out players who have a lot of games interactions with referees\n # could there be something in which most players who are black have played little games (# not really so we will ignore)\n \n# we did not consider the moderating effect of the referee's country which has an implicit bias"

I have to revise this outline and turn it into a formal outline with a lot more detail and specificity than what I have here, from both source material and my own analysis and contribution. Provide targeted, detailed and actionable suggestion. Be specific and precise. Evaluate first with what follows and then I will ask more targeted questions: A person's level of happiness is determined by their own choice and intentions. (Thesis)\nI. People can choose to be happy for the little things that happen in their lives.\n\uf076 Concession: Some people may not have the choice to be happy for the little things in their lives. For example, someone that has experienced a traumatic event may not be able to find happiness.\nCounter Arguments \na. Focusing on the frequency of positive moments makes people happy.\no Keeps people happy in the long term\no Learning to be happy for the things already in your life\no For example: productive job, romantic partner, several hobbies or interests (Road to happiness/ John Reich and Ed Diener)\no Frequency, not intensity (Ed Diener)\nb. Not waiting for big positive moments to come by\no Waiting may lead to disappointment\no Only lasts for a short period of time\nc. The amount of gratitude a happy person has\no Expressing gratitude makes you happy\n\uf0a7 Craig DeMartino (Kathleen McGowan)\no Study on showing gratitude for the people around you (The Science of Happiness)\nII. A happy person chooses to see the positive side of things.\n\uf076 Concession: On the other hand, some people might argue that a person that always sees only the positive may become gullible to deceit.\na. However, people will not ignore their difficulties/adversities but overcome them.\no John Keats story (Eric G. Wilson)\no Trauma\no Bullying\no Rape(Andrew Solomon Ted Talk)\no Sexuality (Andrew Solomon Ted Talk)\n\uf0a7 Denied housing or jobs, marriage rights, violence, hate crimes\nb. People will use the pain and suffering to learn and become stronger.\no Form your own identity/ meaning(Andrew Solomon Ted Talk)\no Making our difficulties purposeful\no Being proud of who you are because of the adversities\no Learning from them\nIII. To gain happiness people\u2019s perspectives need to change. \n\uf076 Concession: Some people may find that altering their outlook on life does not lead to happiness because they may be stuck in a cycle of negative thinking. Focusing too much on achieving happiness can cause feelings of guilt and pressure, leading to further unhappiness. \na. In spite of this, changing how you see social media can help reduce feelings of guilt and pressure. \no Choosing to not feel bad about your life because of what other people post online\no Choosing to disregard or ignore bad comments about yourself \nb. Surrounding yourself in a positive environment will have a major impact on your mindset.\no How you perceive the events happening around you\n\uf0a7 The negatives\no Taking in the emotions around\n\uf0a7 Surrounding yourself with good and happy vibes\no How you think people perceive you\nIV. A person can create his or her own happiness by intentionally engaging in activities and training their minds.\n\uf076 Concession: However, some people may be predisposed to happiness or unhappiness due to their genes.\na. Training the mind to be happy can be an effective way to increase overall wellbeing.\no Tomato sauce (Choice, happiness and spaghetti sauce Malcolm Gladwell)\nb. Intentional activity can help people gain happiness by focusing on positive experiences, prioritizing meaningful goals and activities, and cultivating relationships with others.\no Knowing what makes you happy\no Practicing/ acting those things (John Reich)\no People can create their own stories ( Emily Smith)\no acts of kindness(Lyubomirsky)\nV. Happy people chose to have a purposeful life. \n\uf076 Concession: A purposeful life does not necessarily equate to a happy life. One can have a purposeful life and still be unhappy.\na. Four pillars of leading to a meaningful life ( Emily Smith)\no Belonging\no Purpose\no Transcendence \no Storytelling\nb. Relationships and friendships are a key part of having a fulfilling life, and having a purpose helps to keep us motivated and driven.\no what kind of people around you/ supportive people\n\uf0a7 surround yourself with people that are positive\n\uf0a7 giving or helping others makes you happy(Todd B. Kashdan and Robert Biswas-Diener)\no Deriving meaningful relationships or purpose at work or in what you do\n\uf0a7 Example TED talk (Chip Conley) maid\nVI. Happy people make conscious decisions to take care of their physical and mental wellbeing by eating nutritious food, exercising regularly and getting enough sleep. They also tend to be more mindful, focusing on the present moment and being more aware of their thoughts and emotions.\n\uf076 Concession: Other people, however, may not be able to make these choices due to outside stressors, and may not have the time or resources to do so.\na. People who suffer from an injury or illness still have ability to choose how much happiness they acquire. They can choose to focus on the positive aspects of the situation, or they can choose to dwell on the negative. Whatever they choose will have a direct effect on their overall wellbeing.\no Kris Carr diagnosed with cancer (Carlin Flora)\no Bobby Muller\u2019s experience ( Kathleen McGowan)\no Tracy Cyr ( Kathleen McGowan)\nb. With a strong sense of motivation, we are more likely to feel a sense of accomplishment and joy when we achieve our goals, leading to increased feelings of happiness.\no Doing things that may be difficult but will bring you closer to being happy\n\uf0a7 Exercise\n\uf0a7 Journaling\n\uf0a7 Eating Healthy\no Leo Babauta (Carlin Flora)\no Meditation"

Written during the pandemic and following a breakup, Blais has used his distinctive musical voice to create a defiantly uplifting record with glistening instrumental textures and warm major tonalities. The album\u2019s title refers to the \u201caubade\u201d, a Middle Ages morning love song about lovers separating at daybreak, a dawn serenade.\n\nDespite the difficult global and personal backdrop, Blais described the time writing this album as a \u201cfruitful moment of creativity for me. We started having hares in the park, beautiful butterflies flying everywhere. It was a time of lots of blossoming, and also a moment when I blossomed from being a pianist into a composer.\u201d Musical ideas captured in over 500 recorded piano improvisations were transformed by Blais into 11 compositions performed by a 12-person ensemble. During the composition process, Blais collaborated with Alex Weston, former music assistant to Philip Glass. The musicians were recorded with close-up microphones, creating a richly intimate atmosphere that captures the human behind each instrument, from the mechanics of the woodwind keys to the snap of a double bass... more\ncredits\nreleased February 4, 2022\n\n \n\n \n\nMKX\\_300dpi\n\n \n\nCerys Weetch\n\nLabel / A&R Manager\n\nMercury KX, 4 Pancras Square, London, N1C 4AG\n\nM: +44 (0)7792959309\n\nwww.mercurykx.com\n\n---"

Lack of professional content from resellers\n3. A little uncomfortable with supplementation\n\"4. Lack of Windows-based program support (bulletin boards, components, etc.)\nLack of various Windows-based hosting offerings\nLack of technical support for security server certificate linkage\"\n5.There has been no inconvenience so far.\n6. None\n7.Service and hosting and CS management tools provided by the agency to end users (wordpress plug-in format)\n8. Nothing in particular\n9.In the past, I used to do wired counseling myself, but these days, I'm disappointed.\n10. None\n\"11. There are too many functions that are not available in the Cafe24 reseller hosting service. I want you to subdivide it further so that users can use it at a low price as needed.\nFor example, moving from high-capacity hosting to low-capacity hosting is not possible! \"There is only an expensive subdomain application on Windows Server, and the payment function is working in Cafe24 solutions or builders, and even if you ask for it, you only get an answer to do it yourself.\"\n12.My Service Management > Domain-related links are too difficult to access.(Is it just me?)\n13.What are you doing? I think it's amazing. If you look at the evolution of the shopping mall manager page, you're saying that this place is a genius. The designer is so cool and I am proud to be the number one hosting company in Korea... I think there are people who are dissatisfied with this, people who are dissatisfied with everything. He's so good at this. What else do you want? Right~~~~~~~~~^^ Cafe24 fighting! Thanks to you, I'm making a living.\n14. Satisfied\n15. I found out today that the extension will not be extended after two months. If travel agencies, which have been suspended for a considerable period of time due to COVID-19, ask them to open the gate again, it will be difficult if there is no backup.\n16.There is no big inconvenience.\n17. Same as the answer to the above question\n18. Domain registration management function seems to lack support because it is a reseller.\n19. I'm generally satisfied.\n20. Providing a wide range of management tools for servers (web+DB) and requesting improvement in 1:1 customer support usage.\n21.Connection is difficult, especially the actual person in charge cannot be wired (There was a reseller person in the past...)\n22. Management pages have remained the same for almost 20 years.\n23. Difficulty connecting engineers in the event of a failure\n24.Inquiry bulletin board answers are sometimes slow... I want you to specify the reason.\n25. In the case of a reseller, I hope that the complicated matters will be resolved quickly by direct phone call with the person in charge. Answers often come too simple without a last name.\n26. Satisfied\n27. There is no management for long-term customers. (Server aging, high cost compared to current service cost)\n28.No.\n29. None\n30. It's too difficult or not to build a name server for the developer, not a customer (really hard!)\n31.Domain-related parts above\n32.No, I'm not.\n33. Add shopping mall function (like Woo-commerce)\n34. The knowledge on the server side is difficult for almost all agencies to respond.\n35.Inquiry is a bit uncomfortable.\n36. None\n37. As mentioned above, limited ssh environment\n38.There isn'\n39. The response to customer inquiries seems to be getting slower than before.\n40. Insufficient UI provision for customer management\n41. If the 1:1 response to customer inquiries is sometimes too late...It's a website that's open, but when you respond too late,\n42.There is none.\n43.Uncomfortable using groupware\n44. There are times when the response to service failure is not fast, phone and chat connection are not smooth, and the answer is not good.\n45.I'm not sure yet.\n46.Reseller module is aging and specific services are limited\n47. Change to low speed when traffic is exceeded (currently site closed)\n48. The handling of disability response is delayed\n49.1:1 Answer / Traffic Information ui / Marketing Analysis\n50. Responsive support, builder hosting convenience function not supported\n51. Waiting time for customer center response\n52. Realizing External Systems\n53.I'm using it well.\n54. Sub-specification conversion of services\n55. None\n56.Telephone\n57.There seems to be no difficulty so far.If we operate more, it would be convenient for resellers to check traffic or hard capacity on the entire list item, not on individual site pages.\n58.Sangdong Corporation\n59. I have a lot to say, but I won't.\n60.I hope the reseller customer service will be faster and more professional.\n61.When the hosting expires, I hope the data storage period will be increased from 3 months.\n62.It's hard to get help because I don't want improvements to solve the problem.\n63.Improvement of webmail service functionality and access to groupware products (the conditions of service use are strict)\n64.Please apply reactive code to the current builder function.\n65. I hope the phpmyadmin function will be re-established.\n66.I'm very satisfied.\n67. Quick CS response, active consulting\n68.Reseller Slow Updates\n69. There are times when I find it difficult to use.\n70.Database security (encryption) service\n71.You keep telling me to look for something on the bulletin board.\n\"72. Domaine registration cannot be managed in the Risuli administrator's account.\nCustomer visibility is reduced when only domains are registered without web hosting\"\n73.

When renewing the security certificate, downloading the http authentication file causes the existing file to go down.\n77.Nothing.\n78.Reorganization of Reseller Sites\n79. Late response to customer inquiries\n80.MYSQL Check Your Site Directly\n81.It is inconvenient because it is handled only through the bulletin board and it is not processed quickly.

YouTube\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9KCQ5UiQDs\n\nTranscript:\n(00:00) a standard business a typical business versus an alpha 2.0 business alpha 2.0 is the name of the business model that i teach i've been teaching stuff for over 10 years in the internet thousands of guys have done this it's really nice when you start your own business you do not want to start the typical business that your dad would tell you to start the typical business has several problems number one it is location dependent that means that you are selling to customers who live in your city so you build this business great\n(00:32) now you have a business and then you want to move or your country starts to collapse like what's happening in the western world right now or your region gets crappy or you just change your mind you want to move somewhere else now you're screwed because you're location dependent your traditional standard business has rooted you to your location for the rest of your life that's not freedom that's not a good idea instead you wanted out the 2.\n(00:57) 0 business that is location independent that means the money comes in regardless of where you are where you travel where you live how long you're there a hundred percent of my income i have three companies they're all alpha two funnel businesses a hundred percent of my income comes in every month every week regardless of where i am where i live where i travel i can go anywhere i want in the world be there for as long as i want and the money just keeps coming in because it's location independent and again most businesses that you would start most\n(01:27) businesses that normal people start are not location independent they're location dependent the second problem with standard companies is that they are infrastructure heavy that means you need lots of things like employees you need inventory you need overhead in some cases you need a physical location a brick building some cases not depends if it's an online business or not but even if it's an online virtual business you still have to have employees you have to have an hr department you have to pay w2 taxes it's a big giant\n(01:59) mess and as a business consultant with over 25 years of experience where i work with literally hundreds of companies i will tell you for a fact that most business owners of standard businesses spend anywhere from 40 to 60 percent of their time screwing around with their infrastructure their employees their vendors their inventory all the crap their technology all the crap that they have to have in their business in order to maintain their income alpha 2.\n(02:26) 0 business is infrastructure light [Music] i make a very high let's say six figure income it might be more than that but let's say i make a very high six figure income i have three companies i have about 17 income streams my entire business is run from my laptop right over there that's it that's all the infrastructure i have i have no buildings i have no employees i have a team i have a team of 17 or so people but i have no employees which means i have no hr function i don't have to pay all the employee taxes\n(02:56) payroll taxes things like that i have authority over when to hire when to fire people because they're all subcontractors i don't have any inventory i don't need a physical location to warehouse stuff i don't have any technical equipment i don't have anything weird i just have my laptop which means my business in terms of business costs is very low when your business costs are very low you donate a lot of customers or a lot of clients to make a high income when you have lots of infrastructure you have\n(03:21) to make a lot of money just to pay the bills of the business and then you get the scraps that are left over most companies make around six percent in terms of profit the ones that are profitable my companies make anywhere from eighty to ninety percent profit sometimes seventy percent profit big difference because i keep the infrastructure light now because of all this because of all these location dependent and infrastructure problems most standard companies are high work that means that most business owners will quit their job with working 40\n(03:51) hours a week this is an old joke to run a business a standard business to work 50 60 70 hours a week for the rest of their lives the 2.0 business model is low work you don't want to work long hours for the rest of your life right once you get your this business structure up and running because it's low infrastructure because it's location dependent you don't need to work long hours to maintain the business the max we teach is 30 hours a week let me erase that 30 hours max per week to maintain the\n(04:24) business and as i said in the last video there are some guys who work a lot less than that like a lot less than that now if you want to work more than 30 hours a week you can but that's your choice i work a lot more than 30 hours a week because i have big goals i want a lot of money i like money because i have big goals i lack a lot of money i have a very strong mission i'm passionate about and i love to work so i choose to work more than 30 hours a week but i don't have to i don't have to work more than\n(04:47) 30 hours we probably need more than 20 hours a week to maintain my current income and that's an option that you will never have if you start a standard business so when you start a business be very very careful about these aspects it's easier to start one of these because that's what everybody starts a business with a building with their name on it or if it's a virtual business a whole bunch of employees you're going to screw around with and have lots of inventory or equipment or controls or employees and\n(05:10) they're going to spend most of your time busting your ass managing all that infrastructure you don't want to do that you want to have a business that sets you free not a business that imprisons you and again i will tell you for a fact most business owners have businesses that own them i own my businesses they follow my orders not the other way around if you want more information on how to set up a business like this or other international backup plans and things like that you should check out my youtube channel at sovereign ceo you can\n(05:36) click the link below or wherever the link is and i will see you in the next video i will see you very soon"

My grandmother Clarice was born in Pelham, Texas, a freedmen\u2019s town. She took us grandchildren back for homecoming most years, sometimes even had us pick cotton, reminding us, \u201cYou\u2019ve got to know your history.\u201d She also told us of the folks she knew in Pelham as a child, some of whom were born enslaved, a fact that horrified me. Clarice always refused my sympathies. \u201cChild, don\u2019t be believing what folks say about how bad slavery was,\u201d she\u2019d explain. \u201cEverybody had a job, a place to stay and something to eat. Now if somebody came and paid your rent, you wouldn\u2019t be sitting up talking about you wanna leave, would you?\u201d This dumbfounded me, until I realized she was mostly joking. But there was something deeper in her response. I eventually learned more about the violence that met newly emancipated Black Texans. Ku Klux Klansmen, along with local officials and everyday citizens, terrorized freedmen at will and without repercussions. They burned churches and homes, intimidated those who sought employment, and worse. Gen. Joseph Jones Reynolds, a commander of the Department of Texas during Reconstruction, commented in 1868, \u201cThe murder of Negroes is so common as to render it impossible to keep an accurate account of them.\u201d The Equal Justice Initiative has tried, reporting that more than 2,000 Black women, men and children were victims of racial terrorist lynchings during Reconstruction, which lasted from 1865 to 1877. Slavery was awful, no doubt, but emancipation brought its own unique cruelties. Formerly enslaved Texans were forced to craft lives from less than scratch; choose new names; attempt to reunite with stolen partners, siblings, children. They faced daily threats of jail or worse because of the new Black codes that severely restricted their freedom \u2014 their freedom to work, but also their freedom to be unemployed or even to stand still for too long. The more I learned, the more I understood my grandmother\u2019s perspective. She\u2019d heard the testimonies of those who\u2019d had to navigate both the tragedy of slavery and the terror of emancipation. She couldn\u2019t let me underestimate the enormous price our people had paid to be free. I miss Clarice so much some days, it\u2019s hard to think straight. I regret not asking more questions about our family, about her life in Pelham. As more folks in Clarice\u2019s generation pass away, we are losing the final physical links to those who know our history \u2014 who are our history. We can do no better this Juneteenth than to spend time with the elders who are still with us. Get them to talk. Record their stories. These historical and systemic injustices have not been resolved. But as Black Americans, we cannot wait for the day when our country will pay the respect that is due our forebears \u2014 or pay us those reparations. Instead of holding our breath, let us find the freshest air we can find and breathe it as deeply as we can, with joy. Let us grieve for our forebears and feel deep gratitude as we think of the enormous price our people paid so we could be free. Let us remember that despite the degradation of slavery, they lived fully human lives, too. They laughed. They loved. They dreamed. They ate sweet treats. Let us pray to them and say, this year and always: Thank you.\"\"\"\" \n\nArgument 2: an excerpt from \"\"\"\"Juneteenth Reminds Us to Think About Economic Freedom, Not Just Legal Liberty\"\"\"\" by Peter Coy: \n\n\"\"\"\"...[W]hen emancipation came, the first thing formerly enslaved people wanted was land, which they rightly saw as a prerequisite for real independence. \u201cThe way we can best take care of ourselves is to have land, and turn it and till it by our own labor,\u201d a Baptist minister named Garrison Frazier told the secretary of war, Edwin Stanton, and the Union general William Sherman in a meeting in Savannah, Ga., in January 1865. Four days later Sherman famously promised 40 acres of land to each formerly enslaved family (the \u201cand a mule\u201d part came later). But the federal government never followed through on its promise of land \u2014 and thus true independence \u2014 to formerly enslaved people. Economics entered into the picture, Stanley said: If African Americans grew subsistence crops on their own plots, who would cultivate and harvest all the cotton, tobacco, sugar and rice grown on the vast plantations? After the Civil War, in lieu of land distribution, slavery was replaced by sharecropping, in which planters allowed tenant farmers to keep a portion of the crops they raised. That subjugated the tenants to the owners almost as surely as slavery did. At the same time, industrialization in the North meant that more and more white Americans were working for wages \u2014 about two-thirds by 1875, according to Stanley. Many drew the connection between themselves and African Americans. Eugene Debs, who led the Pullman railroad strike of 1894, said, \u201cThe paternalism of the Pullman is the same as the interest of a slaveholder in his human chattels. You are striking to avert slavery and degradation.\u201d Today, the phrase \u201cwage slavery\u201d invoked by Debs and others has lost its punch. Many people who work for wages are doing very nicely, thank you. And many farmers and business owners, supposedly more independent, are buffeted by forces beyond their control, from bad weather to nasty customers. What hasn\u2019t changed, 157 years after the Juneteenth proclamation, is that a majority of African Americans continue to lack wealth. The median wealth of Black families in 2019 was just $24,100, versus $142,500 for white families, according to a Federal Reserve survey. Something needs to change, but what? The nature of the economy has changed, and few people still think that the solution to inequality is to give people plots of land to farm. We are enmeshed economically with one another in ways that Jefferson could not have imagined. Instead of land grants, the new protections for workers are unionization, government regulation and profit-sharing, Stanley said. One can quibble over her formula, but the motivation behind it is unquestionable. Freedom \u2014 which must include economic freedom \u2014 is just as important now as it was on the original Juneteenth.\"\"\n\nComparison of the two perspectives on Juneteenth and discussion of insights to be gained from the comparison:"

This is prompt\n\nIn Cannibal Capitalism, Nancy Fraser argues that we need an expanded understanding of capitalism beyond simply a focus on production in order to understand the range of crises affecting the world. In this paper, explain how Fraser extends Marx\u2019s insights about capitalism to show how capitalism is producing crises but also how these crises afford us avenues for progressive social and political change.\n\nCould you improve my essay below to get A \n\n-----\nThe idea that the market is a panacea for our life\u2019s problems is a central tenet of neoclassical economic thought. Neoclassical economics is a school of economic thought that emphasizes the value of free market competition and how individuals make decisions based on rational calculations of costs and benefits. It assumes that markets are self-regulating and efficient in allocating resources, and that individuals are rational agents who make decisions based on their own self-interest. The invisible hand of the market determines the price based on the supply and demand and maximizes social welfare. This argument has been used to justify the free market policies such as privatization of public services, industry deregulation and the reduction of government intervention in the economy. However, this belief is increasingly being challenged by scholars. While the market can be an effective mechanism for allocating certain resources and creating wealth, it is not a panacea for the social, racial, economic, and environmental challenges that we face today.\nKarl Marx, a renowned German philosopher, developed a unique perspective on capitalism, socialism, and communism. His understanding of capitalism differs significantly from neoclassical economists, which asserts that economic activity cannot be understood as a mere process of exchange, but is shaped by the social relations of production (Fraser, 2022, p20). He criticizes the idea of neoclassical economics for failing to address the underlying relations of exploitation and class conflict that are hardwired into capitalism, and for focusing solely on the exchange of goods and services in the market. In contrast, he views capitalism as a system of class domination centered on the exploitation of free labor by capital in commodity production (Fraser, 2022, p44). He analyzes the structure through which a small group of capitalists who own the means of production extract surplus value from the majority of people who have to sell their labor. This results in a system of inequality and exploitation, with capitalists profiting from the labor of workers.\nNancy Frazer, an American philosopher and feminist shares the view with Marx that capitalism is a system that organizes the relation of production and exchange to their non-economic conditions of possibility (Fraser, 2022, p85). Besides, she appreciates the lens of exploitation he introduces as it highlights the structural basis in capitalist society for the class domination of free workers (Fraser, 2022, p45). However, she criticizes and extends Marx\u2019s view in her book Cannibal Capitalism as she believes that his view does not account for the realm of non-economic activity that is bound up with exploitation sufficiently. She contends that non-marketized aspects such as social reproduction, polity, and natural resources are indispensable to marketized aspects of capitalist societies and ignoring or treating them as if they are infinite and free leads to the cannibalization of our society (Fraser, 2022, p37). In capitalist society, there is a boundary between \"production\" from \"reproduction,\" \"economy\" from \"polity,\" and \"society\" from \"nature\" to distinguish between them. These resources necessary for economic activity are often viewed as having no monetary value and are taken for granted as if they are free and infinitely available. As they assume no responsibility for sustaining them, this leads to a crisis in social reproduction, race, and ecology. She claims that these crises worsen each other and pose a significant threat to our survival (Fraser, 2022, p16).\n Social reproduction involves not only the activity of reproducing new human beings , but also the maintenance of social bonds that underpins social cooperation (Fraser, 2022, p24). This includes tasks such as giving birth, performing household chores, and socializing the young. However, in capitalist societies, social reproduction is often detached from economic production, leading to care work and affective labor being undervalued unless they are commodified and turned into paid labor (Fraser, 2022, p25). Thus, she criticizes the Marxist view for not fully explaining that behind the process of production is unwaged care work, often performed by women, which replenishes the labor force.This presents a paradox, as the capitalist economy relies on social bonds, but does not accord them monetary value. This ultimately impairs the system\u2019s ability to produce and maintain labor power (Fraser, 2022, p64, p85). \n\nAnother precondition for the functioning of capitalism is public powers, usually states, that supply legal and military might that enforce and establish constitutive norms (Fraser, 2022, p27). Public power encompasses various functions, such as enacting legal orders, maintaining repressive forces, and providing public goods that serve to guarantee property rights, enforce contracts, settle disputes, and sustain the money supply that is essential to the survival of capital (Fraser, 2022, p116). Legal systems establish what appears to be politically neutral spaces where private actors could pursue their \u201ceconomic\u201d interest without a form of \u201cpolitical\u201d interference. Similarly, at the geopolitical level, transnational political arrangements such as international law and brokered agreements among the Great Powers enable people to expand their business across borders.Accumulation and market exchange are impossible without such a legal and military framework. \n\nLast thing that production depends on is nonhuman nature, which is both a key input including raw materials and sources of energy for capitalists and a dumpster for their rubbish (Fraser, 2022, p85). In their pursuit of profit maximization, capitalists seek to exploit nature as cheap as possible by disavowing the ecological costs generated by production. Their perspective is rooted in the myth that nature can replenish itself infinitely and autonomously.\nWorks Cited\nFraser, N. (2022).

arc\nbrowser it's fairly new to the market um\nthey actually were created as company in\ndecember 2020 and essentially they've\nhad a fair few the head of designer\ntesla medium multiple google chrome\naluminum and lots more famous faces\nheading over there and they're building\na browser that's not boring i'm going to\ngive you a first look at it but please\nnote that this is they've given me beta\naccess which is really kind but it's so\nearly days in terms of its official\nrelease so i did even notice some small\nthings that obviously\nyou won't get in the final version\nhopefully anyway\nand i'll include um the current wait\nlist below and if i have any invites as\nwell i'll see what i can do too so\nbefore we begin my name is francesco and\ni run key productive we're going to be\ndiving into plenty of productivity\nreviews this is a bit of a weird one\nbecause we don't normally do browser\nreviews but this is more of a\ninteresting type of browser and it's got\nsome really interesting productivity\nelements as part of it so i'm excited to\ndive into this review so downloading\nthis application is by far one of the\nbest experiences for onboarding it\nreally takes you through\nsmall things like creating your account\nalso connecting to existing applications\nlike if you've got google chrome\nbookmarks and things like that ready\nit'll take you through that whole\nexperience and safari as well if you do\nhave that one and what's really nice is\nit really educates you about how to use\nthe browser before necessarily jumping\nin so the course structure of this is\nprobably the thing to start with the arc\nbrowser takes a different approach to\nfor example google chrome by removing\nmore of these sort of toolbars so you\ncan essentially go into this beautiful\nfull screen view from day one and really\nfeel like you're cocooned in the website\nmore than actually being stuck and sort\nof you know uh i guess with mess around\nthe edges they've really embraced that\napproach with the sidebar as well which\nyou can pop open and be able to change\ntabs as well and they've also got a\ncommand bar which helps you to toggle\nbetween different websites or bookmarks\nthat you may have for easy and quick\naccess one thing i really liked about\nthis browser is their new feature called\nsplit view this essentially is much like\nmobile browsers where you can pop a\ndifferent view open at the same time and\nbe able to view two things at once and\nbasically it's just easier to be able to\ndo that instead of having sort of tabs\nand switching between them it's really\neasy to do and you can toggle each one\nto fit your comfort levels as well in\nterms of customization so the way they\ngo about organizing your arc browser is\nthrough spaces so if you wanted to\ncreate tabs for different areas so for\nexample like general or work or life or\nspecific project you're working on you\ncan actually do that and scrobble\nbetween them which is a really nice\nfeature you can also do a few different\nproductivity things like for example\nhaving your own library on there of\nfiles images that connect to things like\nyour desktop and downloads on the mac\nbrowser which is perfect for dragging\nstuff into websites if you're looking to\ndo that quite fast\nand for collaborating in real time one\nthing i really like about this browser\nwas the new easel thing so basically\nit's like a bit of the collaboration\nwhiteboard which you can flip open at\nany time and start dragging things into\nit but also visually demonstrating\nthings so this is nice for sharing with\nteam members that you might want to\nstart collaborating on whilst you're\ninside of the web another thing that was\nreally nice is they actually have a new\nnotability allowing you to create a\nbasic note with images and the regular\ntext formatting that you expect a really\nsimple thing on the browser that really\ngoes a long way and i like as well how\nyou can take screenshots of a specific\npart of the page really easily and be\nable to annotate them straight away and\ni really like how you can send them to\nspecific easel or notes that you're\nworking on too to be honest i quite like\nthis collaboration abilities and just\nbeing able to modify it a little bit\nmore i've actually found another\nextension that looks pretty cool on on\ngoogle chrome and that's what the cool\nthing is as well is they still have\nextensions on this application which i\nbelieve you can get through the google\nchrome web store so extensions wise\nyou'll still be able to use the regular\nset of extensions that you'd expect with\nyour arc browser and it would be using\nthe google chrome web store so very\ninteresting approach to that i'll have\nto look in a bit more detail on this as\nwell they also have this feature called\nboost i wasn't able to use it because of\nmy skill set\nbut i think you can modify code on\nspecific site and change it to how\nyou like it if you're a css or developer\nand you want to make a few modifications\nthat make a site look better that you\nroutinely visit that's my understanding\nof it but much more for brighter minds\nof myself so when it comes to pricing\nand availability right now it's in beta\nso it's closed beta so invite only i\nreally like when you get started with\nthis you get your own card sort of quite\nvery nice feel when you join the\ncommunity and\nthe way that they've built this\napplication is is really stunning to be\nhonest i'll probably start lightly using\nthis i don't like to necessarily\ncompletely convert to it but it will\ntake some time to get used to some\ncertain things did take the differences\nhaving that tab sidebar to be able to\nfind stuff that was weird and difficult\nto get used to however i think these are\nsort of things that are very minor\nthings it'll take a time to naturally\nnavigate i've been using safari for like\na year or so now i previously was google\nchrome so we're traditionally set to\nwhat we think about the web but this is\nan interesting fresh approach with much\nbetter design much better productivity\nfeatures built in and an interesting\napproach to tabs and being able to\nmanage them in spaces so a very nice\nfirst look at this i'm impressed and i'm\ngoing to be keeping an eye on how they\ndevelop this experience and how\nand what to expect in the future so\nthanks to the arc team for hooking me up\nwith an account hopefully you folks\nfound this video useful if you're\ninterested in in more of our reviews you\ncan check out our youtube channel which\nyou can subscribe to below but a big\nthank you for stopping by today and i\nhope to see you all very soon cheerio\nfolks"

She\u2019ll be flying home with the body tomorrow for a weekend funeral.\n\nLenore arrives and makes funeral arrangements. She loves Roxie dearly, and pulls a softer side of the girl out from beneath her bratty teenage veneer. Roxie\u2019s beautiful when she has her wig off, stunning even.

On errands about town, she\u2019s recognized by fans of her old tv show. Everyone mentions how unfair it was when they killed her character, but we don\u2019t know why. She takes Roxie to lunch one weekend at a local diner. Mike, Allison and their friend TARA (16) enter the diner and Mike\u2019s nice enough to come over and say hello/introduce himself to Lenore. Afterwards, we hear Tara gossiping with Mike. She tells him Roxie has alopecia/no hair!\n\nAt the beach club soon after, on a rainy day, Mike comes over to the concession stand to shelter from the storm.

        "value": "Please sum: Hey, there. At this point, you should have a firm understanding of what it means to empathize with users. To really understand how users think and feel, you need to talk to them directly. One way you can learn from real people about their needs is by conducting interviews. But how can you find and recruit people to interview? In the next few videos, we'll go over what you need to do to recruit participants, prepare for interviews, and conduct interviews. Are you ready? Let's get started with how to recruit participants first. As you can probably imagine, recruiting participants who are available to be interviewed takes time and planning. When you're on the job in the real world, you might start with a screener survey to help identify the best candidates to interview for your research study. A screener survey or simply screener, for short, is a detailed list of questions that helps researchers determine if potential participants meet the requirements of the research study. For the purposes of this course, you aren't required to create a screener, but it is a good tool to be familiar with for the future. Whether you use a screener survey or just move straight to recruiting, you should start with one important step: determine the interview goals. To determine the goals of the interview, ask yourself questions like the following: What do you want to learn from the interviews? Are there certain user problems or pain points that you need to empathize with? Are there any characteristics of users you want to interview? Why? How much information should we have to ensure we get a comprehensive and balanced set of data? Write a clear list of goals to explain why you are conducting interviews, which will help determine the characteristics of participants who will be ideal for you to meet with. For example, imagine you're designing a weather app for the project in this course. The goal of your interviews during the empathize phase could be to understand emotions that people experience related to unpredictable weather. Or imagine you're designing a shopping app. During interviews, you may want to identify common user behaviors and experiences involved in shopping online, like adding and removing items from a cart. As you start recruiting, aim to form a representative sample. A representative sample is a subset of the target population that seeks to accurately reflect the characteristics of the larger group. The participants in a representative sample should include user groups that have been commonly under-represented in previous research. This lack of representation is often the result of biases due to age, race, gender, or ability. Having a diverse pool of participants to choose from will help you create great experiences for all users. Once you've determined the goals of your interviews, it's time to continue the recruitment process. To do this, we'll explore how to search for potential interview participants. In the real-world, there are lots of factors that determine how and where UXers find potential interview participants. For example, finding people to interview can depend on the company you work for, the type of product you're designing, time constraints for the projects, the projects' budgets, and the accessibility of the people you want to interview. For the purpose of this course, you may be limited on who you can find to be part of your study, so all of the methods we're going to discuss may not be an option for you at the moment. That's okay. To begin your search, start by creating a list of who you know personally. You can also ask people from your professional circles, such as your current or former colleagues, managers, or even peers in this course. Once you've compiled a list of people you know, move on to people you don't know. Perhaps the easiest way to recruit interview participants outside of your immediate network, is through social networks or online platforms. We already mentioned finding people to interview through your social media profiles. You can also connect with potential interviewees via professional networking sites like LinkedIn. Online groups based on personal interests are another great resource. For example, if you're designing an app for musicians, you might find an online group about creating music through a Google search or on social media sites like Facebook or Reddit. So you have quite a few ideas for how to find people to interview for your project in this course. I also want to share a couple of ways that you might find interview participants in the real world on the job. Keep in mind though that these two methods are not expected for the purposes of this course. One method you might use is a third-party research recruiting agency. This means that the agency you hire finds people for you to interview. Recruiting agencies are useful because they save you time and can often reach a greater diversity of users than you might be capable of reaching on your own. However, please note, for this course, you are not expected to hire a third-party recruiting agency. Hiring a recruiting agency costs money, so you will likely only use this method if you're working on a project that has a budget for this service. You and your team may also choose to connect with research participants through paid services like usertesting.com or userinterviews.com. Hopefully, you now have a decently-sized list of people you can ask to participate in your interviews. You may decide to reach out to these participants based on who's available. Or if you are sending a screener survey, you might select the candidates who align best with your interview goals. Either way, it's likely that a few candidates will stand out quickly as ideal candidates. When you are ready, reach out to each perspective participant. The most common way to do this is via email. Let's explore what you should include. Start with a greeting that introduces yourself and the project, then briefly explain why you are reaching out to them. Include logistics for the interview, like location, date, and time. Next, explain the setup for the interview. This is a good time to explain any parts of the interview that you'll need their consent for, like recording audio or video. Begin wrapping up your email by letting the participant know how they should confirm their interview time if they are interested. This can either be through a link to schedule their interview or through an email reply. If you have the budget, add an incentive like a gift card. This always helps sweeten the deal and makes participants excited to interview. Finally, close the email with a salutation and your name. After you confirm people to interview, it's a good idea to send email reminders the week before the interview and the night before the interview. This will help ensure that the people you've found actually show up for their interview. And that's a wrap. Finding great interview participants takes true effort, but the great research you'll conduct will make it all worth it. In the next video, you'll learn all about preparing for interviews. Good luck."

With colleagues, with partners, with customers\u2026 Is that information in safe hands? Or are files available to people who shouldn\u2019t have access? Florbs mitigates the risk of data exposure by giving Google Workspace admins in-depth insights into file sharing habits. How? Let\u2019s deepdive into 2 ways Florbs can help you:\n1) Identifying file sharing habits\n\n2) How to track where files end up\n\nHow to identify file sharing habits within your domain\nWhen collaborating within Google Workspace, there are multiple ways of sharing to other people\u2019s Google Drive available. Depending on your domain settings, you can share files with:\n\nSpecific users\nSpecific groups\nThe whole domain (with a link)\nAnyone with the link (publicly accessible)\nAll four methods are reflected in your Florbs dashboard:\n\nThe blocks show you an overview of the amount of files that are shared by a specific method\nSo, what are we looking at?\n\nTotal shared:\n\nThe amount of files that a user has shared. E.g: the total amount of all sharing methods combined. This block will provide you with an indication whether there is a lot of (external) collaboration happening.\nShared with anyone:\nThe amount of files that are shared publicly. Everyone with the URL to a file is able to access these files.\nDomain shares:\nThe amount of files that are shared with the whole domain. Everyone within the same domain as the person who shared it is able to access these files.\nGroup shares:\nThe amount of files shared with a group. When you hover over this block, you are able to differentiate between internal and external groups.\nUser shares:\nThe amount of files that are shared with specific users. The most precise and transparent way of file-sharing. Hovering over the block differentiates between internal and external users as well.\n\nBy using your Florbs dashboard, you can see which sharing methods are used the most. And, whether file sharing is done safely. When combining this with the extensive search functionality, you can also track what kind of files are shared which way.\nThis overview shows you if you need to educate your whole organization about sharing habits, or only a few users.\nShare safely, share specifically\nAlthough all different sharing methods have their own advantages and disadvantages, it is a safe option to stick to the principle of least privilege; If people don\u2019t need full access, don\u2019t grant them full access. File sharing management is as important as other safety measures within your domain.\n\nIt is possible to restrict sharing publicly across your domain entirely. However, there are a lot of situations in which files are meant to be shared publicly. If you restrict file sharing, those files will be duplicated/downloaded or sent as attachments . And they will float around in all kinds of different versions. This means that although you won\u2019t see the sharing within your Google Workspace anymore, it is still happening. Luckily, Florbs enables to monitor your Google Drive without forbidding all kinds of options.\n\nDeeper into sharing habits\nLet\u2019s look at the sharing habits of Scott as shown on the screenshot. He shares a lot of files with groups and users, but a lot of them publicly as well. With the amount of files that Scott shared externally, it could be a good idea to check what is happening. Although sharing files using the \u2018anyone with the link\u2019 \u2019option could have been done intentional, it could be done due to being in a hurry or out of ignorance about better sharing methods as well.\n\nBy using the extensive search function you can take a look at what kind of files are shared. This helps you to make a proper estimation whether you want these files floating around, or if you need to revoke some permissions. Educating colleagues on other ways of sharing or a good conversation about a possible need of groups/shared drives is highly recommended when you identify a lot of shares using this method.\n\nSo, are you wondering how to check these habits thoroughly? Let\u2019s deep dive into the extensive search functionality.\nIt can take a bit of effort, but you can reduce the risk of potential trouble: Educate people on sharing methods, create proper groups and shared drives and arrange clear agreements on- and offboarding when projects or collaborations end.\nHow to track where Google Drive files end up\nThere are two ways to track where data ends up. There is an extensive search functionality where you can search for data that matches specific criteria. However, if you want to analyze the data in less depth, there are some blocks that offer a clear overview as well.\n\nThe blocks with \u2018sharing domains\u2019 and \u2018shared external\u2019 offer a quick glance into your domain. They show \u2013 you guessed it \u2013 the domain files are shared with and with which mail addresses the most files are shared. The blocks are quite useful for three purposes:\n\n1) to have an overview of what\u2019s happening within your domain,\n\n2) to identify where possible data exposure could occur and\n\n3) to track remarkable changes.\n\nThese graphs show you important information on the sharing habits of your domain. They identify the domains and users with which the most files are shared. Apparently, there are quite a few shares with personal email addresses (hotmail.com and gmail.com . And what about all those shares with @example.com? Is that collaboration still in place or should these permissions be withdrawn?\n\nDrive audit \u2013 the extensive search functionality\nThe extensive search function allows a more in depth insight into possible data exposure. It is useful to do some research on specific files or domains you\u2019ve seen in the overview or to do some routine checks on specific terms or domains.\nThere are multiple filters available, the filters allow to search for files based on:\n\nName, file ID, shared drive location\nWho files are shared with\nThe file owner\nLocation: shared drives, my drives or orphaned\nExposure: anyone with the link , only domain with the link, restricted or not shared\nThe domain the files are shared with\nType of file (drive files like sheets, docs, forms and lot of other files like audio, video, Apps Scripts, Shortcuts and such as well)\nOr combine multiple of these filters at the same time.\n\nIdentified permissions that need to change? By using these filters you can create bulk actions with just a few clicks. This allows you to change permissions for multiple Google Drive files at once. Select the files you want to change permissions for, click on \u2018add action\u2019 in the upper right corner and change permissions immediately. (Read more about bulk actions and how to create them at this blog)\n\nAnd voila, you can monitor all file-sharing within your domain. Adopt a more in depth file sharing approach, just keep an eye on the file management of the domain or manage your data exposure extensively.\n\nShare this\nLinkedIn\nFebruary 20, 2023\n\nGoogle Workspace management\n\nAbout us\nContact\nCareers\nAdmin Automation\nSecurity & Auditing\nEmail Signature Management\nStart for free\nGet a demo\nPartner\nGeneral Terms and Conditions\nPrivacy policy\nPrivacy Statement (App)"

        "value": "can you tell me if the answer to this question \"The need for achievement based on McClelland's acquired needs theory could be best satisfied by:\na. Becoming an influential leader.\nb. Being accepted by a group\nc. Being well liked\nd. setting/achieving challenging personal goals \n\" is readily answerable from this content \"When your team members succeed, you might be tempted to show them off to the rest of your organization. But while some people thrive in the spotlight, others dread being \"paraded around.\"\n\nManaging a group of people with different personalities is never easy. But if you're managing or leading a team, it's essential to know what motivates your people, how they respond to feedback and praise, and what tasks fit them well.\n\nDavid McClelland's Human Motivation Theory allows you to identify people's motivating drivers. This can then help you to give praise and feedback effectively, assign them suitable tasks, and keep them motivated.\n\nIn this article, we'll explore McClelland's Human Motivation Theory, and look at how you can use it to manage and lead your team more effectively.\n\nNote:\nMcClelland's Human Motivation Theory is also known as Three Needs Theory, Acquired Needs Theory, Motivational Needs Theory, and Learned Needs Theory.\n\nUnderstanding McClelland's Theory\nIn the early 1940s, Abraham Maslow created his theory of needs. This identified the basic needs that human beings have, in order of their importance: physiological needs, safety needs, and the needs for belonging, self-esteem and \"self-actualization\".\n\nLater, David McClelland built on this work in his 1961 book, \"The Achieving Society.\" He identified three motivators that he believed we all have: a need for achievement, a need for affiliation, and a need for power. People will have different characteristics depending on their dominant motivator. [1]\n\nAccording to McClelland, these motivators are learned (which is why this theory is sometimes called the Learned Needs Theory).\n\nMcClelland says that, regardless of our gender, culture, or age, we all have three motivating drivers, and one of these will be our dominant motivating driver. This dominant motivator is largely dependent on our culture and life experiences.\n\nThese characteristics are as follows:\n\nDominant Motivator\n\nCharacteristics of This Person\n\nAchievement\n\nHas a strong need to set and accomplish challenging goals.\nTakes calculated risks to accomplish their goals.\nLikes to receive regular feedback on their progress and achievements.\nOften likes to work alone.\nAffiliation\n\nWants to belong to the group.\nWants to be liked, and will often go along with whatever the rest of the group wants to do.\nFavors collaboration over competition.\nDoesn't like high risk or uncertainty.\nPower\n\nWants to control and influence others.\nLikes to win arguments.\nEnjoys competition and winning.\nEnjoys status and recognition.\nNote:\nThose with a strong power motivator are often divided into two groups: personal and institutional. People with a personal power drive want to control others, while people with an institutional power drive like to organize the efforts of a team to further the company's goals. As you can probably imagine, those with an institutional power need are usually more desirable as team members!\n\nUsing the Theory\nMcClelland's theory can help you to identify the dominant motivators of people on your team. You can then use this information to influence how you set goals and provide feedback, and how you motivate and reward team members.\n\nYou can also use these motivators to craft, or design, the job around your team members, ensuring a better fit.\n\nLet's look at the steps for using McClelland's theory:\n\nStep 1: Identify Drivers\nExamine your team to determine which of the three motivators is dominant for each person. You can probably identify drivers based on personality and past actions.\n\nFor instance, perhaps one of your team members always takes charge of the group when you assign a project. They speak up in meetings to persuade people, and delegate responsibilities to others to meet the goals of the group. They like to be in control of the final deliverables. This team member is likely primarily driven by power.\n\nYou might have another team member who never speaks during meetings. They always agree with the group, work hard to manage conflict when it occurs, and visibly become uncomfortable when you talk about doing high-risk, high-reward projects. This person is likely to have a strong need for affiliation.\n\nStep 2: Structure Your Approach\nBased on the driving motivators of your workers, structure your leadership style and project assignments around each individual team member. This will help ensure that they all stay engaged, motivated, and happy with the work they're doing.\n\nExamples of Using the Theory\nLet's take a closer look at how to manage team members who are driven by each of McClelland's three motivators:\n\nAchievement\nPeople motivated by achievement need challenging, but not impossible, projects. They thrive on overcoming difficult problems or situations, so make sure you keep them engaged this way. People motivated by achievement work very effectively either alone or with other high achievers.\n\nWhen providing feedback, give achievers a fair and balanced appraisal. They want to know what they're doing right \u2013 and wrong \u2013 so that they can improve.\n\nAffiliation\nPeople motivated by affiliation work best in a group environment, so try to integrate them with a team (versus working alone) whenever possible. They also don't like uncertainty and risk. Therefore, when assigning projects or tasks, save the risky ones for other people.\n\nWhen providing feedback to these people, be personal. It's still important to give balanced feedback, but if you start your appraisal by emphasizing their good working relationship and your trust in them, they'll likely be more open to what you say. Remember that these people often don't want to stand out, so it might be best to praise them in private rather than in front of others.\n\nPower\nThose with a high need for power work best when they're in charge. Because they enjoy competition, they do well with goal-oriented projects or tasks. They may also be very effective in negotiations or in situations in which another party must be convinced of an idea or goal.\n\nWhen providing feedback, be direct with these team members. And keep them motivated by helping them further their career goals.\n\nComparative Theories\nMcClelland's theory of needs is not the only theory about worker motivation. Sirota's Three-Factor Theory also presents three motivating factors that workers need to stay motivated and excited about what they're doing: equity/fairness, achievement, and camaraderie.\n\nSirota's theory states that we all start a new job with lots of enthusiasm and motivation to do well. But over time, due to bad company policies and poor work conditions, many of us lose our motivation and excitement.\n\nThis is different from McClelland's theory, which states that we all have one dominant motivator that moves us forward, and this motivator is based on our culture and life experiences.\n\nUse your best judgment when motivating and engaging your team. Understanding a variety of motivational theories will help you decide which approach is best in any given situation.\n\nNote:\nYou may also see these abbreviations for McClelland's three motivators: Achievement (nAch), Affiliation (nAff), and Power (nPow).\n\nKey Points\nMcClelland's Human Motivation Theory states that every person has one of three main driving motivators: the needs for achievement, affiliation, or power. These motivators are not inherent; we develop them through our culture and life experiences.\n\nAchievers like to solve problems and achieve goals. Those with a strong need for affiliation don't like to stand out or take risk, and they value relationships above anything else. Those with a strong power motivator like to control others and be in charge.\n\nYou can use this information to lead, praise, and motivate your team more effectively, and to better structure your team's roles.\""

        "value": "- This jambalaya recipe is Louisiana's classic one-pot meal that's a hearty blend of chicken, sausage, shrimp, veggies, and rice all brimming with spicy and smokey Creole and Cajun flavor. Now, a lot of people are intimidated to make this recipe thinking that it must be difficult to make, but it's actually super easy as long as you don't screw up the rice, and that's where most people go wrong. So I've got some extra tips in today's video to help you out in that area. And while it goes without saying that this recipe is perfect for Mardi Gras, it's also perfect for a tasty weeknight meal year round that'll feed the whole family. So let me show you how to make it.\n\n To get started, we're gonna make a homemade Cajun seasoning from scratch. You can of course buy a packaged Cajun seasoning, but it's so easy to make a blend at home and then save it for future recipes. My version includes three tablespoons of paprika, two tablespoons of kosher salt, two tablespoons of garlic powder, one tablespoon of onion powder, one tablespoon of dried oregano, one tablespoon of dried thyme, one tablespoon of cayenne pepper, and one tablespoon of black pepper.\n\nThe herbs in my blend actually make it a cross between a Creole and a Cajun seasoning but it simplifies many recipes in that you don't have to add those herbs later. And of course, I store the blend in my spice jars which I showed you on my spice drawer organization video.\n\n The flavor base of jambalaya and other Louisiana favorites like gumbo is something called the holy trinity. And it's similar to a French mirepoix of chopped veggies, but instead of celery, carrot, and onion it's celery, bell pepper, and onion. It's also not unlike the Spanish sofrito of aromatic veggies, which includes onion, garlic, bell peppers, and tomatoes. In fact, similar veggie flavor bases are common in many cuisines from Cuban to Colombian, Brazilian, Filipino, and more with slight tweaks here or there. It's a great way to bulk up recipes with veggies and, of course, make everything taste better.\n\n But for today's jambalaya recipe, you'll need two ribs of celery, two bell peppers, and one large onion. And once you've chopped them all up, add them to a mixing bowl.\n\nAnd you can just pile them on top of each other and then set that bowl aside for now. Next up is four garlic cloves. So I'll give them a quick bash with the side of my knife, then peel off their skins.\n\n And then also set these aside to take over to the stove here in a second. When it comes to the protein element of jambalaya, Andouille sausage is a must. This smoked pork sausage originates from France and if you've ever visited New Orleans before you know Cajun food is an eclectic mix of cuisines because of immigrants from many countries. But if you can't find Andouille sausage, you can substitute it with Spanish chorizo which has a similar spice and smoked flavor. You'll need 11 ounces of sausage and you can just slice it up into bite-sized rounds and then add it to a separate prep bowl.\n\n Now, some jambalaya recipes include three proteins which are sausage, chicken, and shrimp and some just include the sausage and shrimp. I personally like to add the chicken, and you can use boneless skinless chicken breast or chicken thighs.\n\nIt's up to you (bright music) But either way, you'll need a pound of chicken. And just chop that up into bite-sized pieces and add it to a mixing bowl. Season the chicken with a tablespoon of your Cajun seasoning, and then use your hands to make sure all the pieces are well coated.\n\n All right, let's get to sauteing a few things. Add two tablespoons of olive oil to a very large Dutch oven or stock pot over medium high heat.\n\nAdd the chicken and saute it for several minutes until it's lightly golden and cooked through. Then remove it to a plate, and I'm just using my flat skimmer as it can scoop up the pieces faster. If you feel like the pot needs a bit more oil, go ahead and add another tablespoon or so and then toss in the sliced sausage.\n\n Try to get the sausage in a single flat layer so that it can nicely brown on one side.\n\nOnce it starts to get that nice crust on it, flip it over and brown the other side. And I should mention that this sausage is already pre-cooked so you don't need to worry about cooking it through. Once that's done, remove it to the same plate or bowl with your cooked chicken. Now the bottom of your pot may look a bit burned at this point but that's all super tasty flavor that will release as soon as we add the holy trinity of veggies.\n\n So dump those into the pot. I'm sure you guys know this from my other recipes but as you saute those chopped onions and veggies, they release moisture and that moisture will naturally deglaze the pan.\n\nSo saute them for about four to five minutes or until they've softened. Add the garlic by mincing it straight into the pot, then add 1/2 a teaspoon of red pepper flakes for extra spice and another tablespoon of Cajun seasoning. Stir that together for 30 seconds or so and then add 1 1/2 cups of rinsed long-grain white rice.\n\n And before we go any further, I'm gonna pause here for a second and tell you where many folks screw up and that's that they cook the rice way too long in the pot and it ends up mushy.\n\nI'm using a white basmati rice today and it only needs to cook for 10 to 12 minutes, but if you really want to ensure firmer separate grains you can use parboiled rice that has been partially boiled in the husk. It's a bit harder to overcook and turn mushy, though it does require more time, about 25 minutes. I've listed these tips on the recipe blog post on my website, but just wanted to call this out as I've heard from too many people who have ended up with mushy jambalaya using a white basmati rice and cooking it for 25 to 30 minutes because that's what some online recipes say to do without talking about the different types of rice. Okay, so back to today's recipe.\n\n I'm using the white basmati rice, so I'll measure out 1 1/2 cups, give that a quick rinse under the faucet, and then we're back to where we were, which is adding it to the sauteed veggies.\n\nStir the rice for a minute minute so it can get all coated in that flavor. Then add one bay leaf, one 15-ounce can of crushed tomatoes, and three cups of low-sodium chicken broth. Though if you opt for the parboiled rice, you'll likely need a bit more broth or liquid. Give that a stir, bring it to a simmer, then reduce the heat to low and cover the pot.\n\n Cook the rice for about seven to eight minutes or until it's just al dente. You do not want it fully cooked at this stage. And I'll stir it once or twice while it's cooking just to make sure it's not sticking to the bottom.\n\nBut don't over stir as that will make it more starchy. (bright music continues) When the rice is al dente and it's still looking a bit soupy, remove the bay leaf and then add one pound of jumbo shrimp, along with your sausage and chicken back to the pot.\n\n Turn off the heat and gently stir this together so that the shrimp get buried in the hot rice and veggies. Then cover the pot. The residual heat should cook the shrimp in about four to five minutes. The chicken and sausage will warm up and all of the residual liquid will be absorbed by the rice as it continues to steam. Your jambalaya recipe is now done and you can see that the shrimp are opaque and pink when you give it a final stir or two.\n\nTrust me when I say that your kitchen is gonna smell like one fantastic Mardi Gras party. And then all that's left to do is add some bright green garnishes, like chopped green onions and parsley. This recipe is such a simple mix of veggies, spices, rice, and protein, and it's a classic one-pot meal that will certainly fill you up and make your taste buds happy. I enjoyed leftovers of this recipe all week long and I was certainly not upset about it. Don't forget that all of the step-by-step details and photos of this recipe are on my website, along with the recipe for the Cajun seasoning and a recipe for creamy Cajun chicken that's pretty darn fantastic and you should definitely try that one as well.\n\n Hit the thumbs up button if you enjoyed this video, share it with your family and friends, and I will see you guys again in the next video.\n\n(bright music continues)."

about setting up a niche we talked about finding a problem to solve we talked about pricing we talked about location dependence and now this is the final step in what you need to do to create your location independent high income low work alpha two penal business and what's interesting is that most guys or women when they start a business they focus on this step first and this is actually the last step and that is to set up a delivery system so delivery system means two things it means how do you deliver the solution that you're offering to the client or customer if that's a service if that's an ebook if that's a course if that's an information product consulting coaching whatever it is okay whatever it is we cover in one of the last videos right how do we deliver that to the customer or client location independent without having to be physically located in that city and if you say well i have to be physically located in that city in order to deliver that thing then either you don't sell that thing or you rejigger that service or thing to make it so you can deliver that service and i've done both these things i have said no to a lot of business opportunities over the past 25 years of my life i've had a lot of interesting offers to get involved with certain people certain companies that probably would have made money but they were location dependent they required me to stay in a certain city so i said no because my freedom is more important than any business model so i'm going to be location dependent for the rest of my life thank you very much and there were other scenarios where most guys would have assumed they were location dependent but instead they weren't for example here's an easy one toward the end of my computer consulting career that's my first business that i started when i was a kid in my mid-20s toward the end of that what i started doing is i realized location dependence was important to me so if my clients wanted me to work really hardcore on a computer or a new computer or a para computer or what have you what i would have them do especially if it was a new computer is i would have them ship the computer to me usually was a laptop so it wasn't a big deal ship it to me overnight i would work on it that day ship it back the next day overnight they'd have it back within two days and it was all set ready to go that worked really really well and there are a lot of guys back then this is years ago a lot of guys back then my competitors who would have never done that they said well that wouldn't have worked worked great so there are location dependent services that you can offer in a location independent fashion as long as you think outside the box so delivery system is first how do you deliver the service or product or information to the client or customer that's the delivery system that's the first part the second part of the delivery system is how do you get the money how do you get the money from the client or customer without physically having to be there now this is a lot easier than it used to be and this is a lot easier it used to be in a postcovid world there are all kinds of mechanisms now where you can deliver hard services soft services information all kinds of things where you don't physically have to be there and then obviously you can get the money from the kleiner customer even if it's a lot of money without physically having to be there i do wire transfers all the time for big big big payments because i run three companies matter of fact just last week i did a wire transfer for what it was 20 000 to a company i do business with internationally and i didn't have to physically be there i'm set up on my online banking to do my own wire transfer so i don't to call a bank every time like most people do because again i'm location independent so this is your delivery system location independent that's the name of the game and if it's not location dependent if the client says i have to give you a check there are still people out there like this matter of fact my wife was just working with a person a little while ago and he was like no i only pay via check if they insist on paying checks you don't do business if it's an old school industry that insists on physically handing you a piece of paper for something you don't do business or you don't do that kind of business everything must be location dependent both the delivery system to the client and the payment system from the client or customer cool now again what most people do when they start a business is this is the first step they go okay i gotta set up a website and i gotta set up a way to you know email the stuff and i gotta set up a check account a paypal account and i gotta set up a merchant account and they do this before they've identified a niche before they've identified a problem before in many cases they even priced out their product or made an offer no this is the final step before you start hardcore marketing which we talked about in the last lesson this is it this is not the first step it's the last step and i have to reiterate that because if you are a more intelligent person higher iq person college educated person what you're going to want to do is focus a lot of time on this no this is the last step before you market the more important steps the ones we already covered in the prior videos especially establishing a niche and structuring your business first then you do this now if you want help with setting up your own location independent business where we actually hold your hand and walk you through the process the 90 day business builder you have access to that now for probably the lowest price it will ever be we will actually over 12 week period we will work with you every week and show you exactly the exact steps on what to do you'll check off when you do them you'll work with an accountability coach if you have trouble doing that 12 week process plus you have a lot of online courses many of the online courses that i have in terms of business and location dependent companies you will get for free as part of this program you get the let's see you get the alpha 2. 0 business course you get the how to get clients course you get big income from little work which is a book i read on how to create location dependent income you get the entire program for 12 weeks you get a lot of stuff for very little money because you will be making money at the end of 12 weeks and if you aren't making any money our guarantees will keep working with you forever until you do because i'm confident you will if you have any interest in doing this especially if you tried a business before in the past and failed or you're nervous about setting up your first business because you haven't done it before or you have been a little lazy in setting up your own business you know it's something you've wanted to do for a long time but you just didn't have the right direction and you need a little more direction a little more accountability if that's you click the link below to schedule your phone call it'll be with me or with one of my coaches depends who you get where there's only a limited time in which you could schedule these calls then we close the window because we only can take on a certain number of people into the program at once so there is a limited number of people who will accept in this and current enrollment for the next 12 weeks click the link below or wherever it is depending on your watching this video to schedule that call it is free you can get all your questions answered we'll go through all the details of how it works if it's not for you that is perfectly fine but if it is for you this could change your life location independent income is the springboard to everything else i talk about in all my other content if you're familiar with my content sovereign ceo moving out of the country getting residencies and passports in other countries living a more free lifestyle avoiding western collapse all that stuff the bedrock foundation of all that is location independent income because if you don't have location dependent income how are you going to move how you're going to leave the country how you be mobile pretty difficult unless you have a lot of money and savings so if you're a lot of money savings and you probably do it for a while and then you need income again don't you this is the cheapest it will ever be it will never be less expensive than this because the next time we do this it will be more expensive so click the link below to schedule your call and i will see you very soon bye\"\nVideo Summary:"

        "value": "The following will be created and hosted using xano.com please list the 20 plust tabel that will be needed and with regards to the refreel tabel please remmber to ref who funds the bonus .....Win\u2019it is a unique online marketplace where merchants and brands can create special offers for customers, giving them a chance to win their money back from a purchase. The platform incentivizes customers to make a purchase by offering them the opportunity to win their money back, which is funded by the merchant. The game is visualized to the player as a wheel of fortune, which creates a fun and engaging experience.\n\nWin\u2019it had been created using Xano.com for its backend.\nWe will create the following logic using python and host it on Amazon with APIs and webhook created on Xano. \n\nVirtual currency, called \"points\nWin\u2019it has its own virtual currency, called \"points,\" with an exchange rate of \u00a31 = 100 points. \n\nPoints earned \nPoints are earned when a player wins a cash reward or takes a cash reward out before playing a cash reward game.\n\nLater, players will be able to perform tasks such as surveys, or give access to transactional data to earn points.\nPoints redeemable\nPoints are redeemable for, \nCash.\nBonus retries.\nMerchant credit. \n\nCashing out \nPlayers can purchase hard currency with points:\nPlayer can convert their points to cash and win it will send the cash to their bank account directly. \nBonus retries\nBonus retries are used in the game when a player plays and loses. \nPlayers obtain bonus retry in two ways\nPurchasing them with their points, \nIn return for refereeing, friends who then make a purchase.\nBonus retries can only be used one per game unless the player has invited 3 new players who have made a purchase, In this case, the player can use unlimited bonus per game\n \nThe odds are based on the cost of winning against the value of the retry. \nFor example, a bonus retry with a value of 100 points will give odds of 1-10 to win \u00a310 cash. \n\nBonus retries can be funded by\n\nWin\u2019it\nMerchant\n\nPurchased Merchant credit\nPlayers can purchase merchant credit with points:\nMerchants can create offers where they sell credits to be used in their stores, and the credit can be sold at face value or a percentage discount. For example, Merchant A sells \u00a31 credit for 50 points, which is a 50% discount, the merchant can also issue credit as a reward that can be issued as the winning prize or as a reward if the player chooses not to play.\n\nIf win\u2019it funds, the bonus reties and the game is for \u201cmerchant credit\u201d the following would happen and need to be reported \n\nWin'it could negotiate with merchants to offer a discount on the cost of the prize or bonus retry credit to reduce the overall cost to Win'it. This could be a way to manage costs and improve profitability for the platform. The discount would be based on a % which could differ with each merchant. \n\nWon or Rewarded Merchant Credit\nThis is Merchant Credit won in a game, or the game is not player and the player choose to take the credit to spend later with the merchant.\n\nMerchant credit should work as follows,\nPlayer \u201cA\u201d has \u00a310 in credit with Merchant \u201cB\u201d \nPlayer \u201cA\u201d spends \u00a35 with Merchant \u201cB\u201d using their linked bank account.\nPlayer \u201cA\u201d bank alerts Win\u2019it via push or pull API call of player transaction.\nWin\u2019it sends \u00a35 to the player.\n\nMerchant Credit can be sent to the player via\nAPI to their linked bank account \nIssuing a QR code via API from the merchant POS \n\nTwo campaign types\nThere are two campaign types that merchants can choose from when creating their offer: a cash reward campaign or a credit reward campaign. \nIn a credit reward campaign, the player receives credit that can be used to purchase goods or services up to the value of the credit. In contrast, a cash reward campaign provides the player with actual cash.\nFor both types of campaigns, the platform will choose the winners using a random number generator, based on the odds defined by the merchant. \n \nHere are some examples of how a credit reward campaign and a cash reward campaign could work on Win\u2019it:\nCredit Reward Campaign:\nOdds of winning: 1-2 (decimal odds of winning are 2.0)\nNumber of transactions played: 10 x \u00a310 = \u00a3100 (average transaction size is \u00a310, and 10 transactions are played)\nTotal revenue generated: \u00a3100 (total value of transactions played)\nNumber of winners: 5\nAmount of credit issued to each winner: \u00a310\nTotal amount of credit issued: \u00a350 (5 winners x \u00a310 credit per winner)\nMerchant's gross profit margin: 80% (merchant keeps 80% of revenue from each transaction, while the remaining 20% is the cost of goods sold, or COGS)\nCost of credit to the merchant: \u00a310 (cost to the merchant for issuing \u00a310 credit to each winner)\nCost of goods sold: \u00a320 (20% of \u00a3100 in revenue)\nNet revenue: \u00a390 (total revenue minus the cost of goods sold\n\nCash Reward Campaign:\nOdds of winning: 1-2 (decimal odds of winning are 2.0)\nNumber of transactions played: 10 x \u00a310 = \u00a3100 (average transaction size is \u00a310, and 10 transactions are played)\nTotal revenue generated: \u00a3100 (total value of transactions played)\nNumber of winners: 5\nAmount of cash issued to each winner: \u00a310\nTotal amount of cash: \u00a350 (5 winners x \u00a310 per winner)\nCost of cash rewards to the merchant: \u00a350 (cost to the merchant for issuing \u00a310 cash to each winner)\nCost of goods sold: \u00a320 (20% of \u00a3100 in revenue)\nNet revenue: \u00a350 (total revenue minus the cost of goods sold and the cost of issuing cash rewards)\nNet profit: \u00a330 (net revenue minus the cost of cash rewards to the merchant)\nIn this example, the merchant funds the cash rewards for the winners, and the odds of winning are determined by the merchant. \n\nOfferwall\nOffers are displayed on our offer wall and searchable based on \nCategory,\nMerchant \nGeolocation \nThe player must opt in to taking an offer for the offer to become active for the player.\nConfirmation of transaction, e.g. purchase\nWhen a player makes a purchase with a merchant offer, they have opted in to win\u2019it can receive confirmation as follows.\n \nVia linked bank account using API provided by https://nordigen.com\nVia merchant POS integration using API\nVia recipe uploaded and read using https://nanonets.com\n\nPlayer wallet \nMerchant Credit Balance\nOffer Status (Active/Redeemed/Expired)\nOffer Date Offered\nOffer Date Redeemed\nTransaction Amount\nTransaction Date\nPoints Earned\nPoints Redeemed\nPoints Balance\nThe Referral Program:\nEach player receives a unique invite code.\nWhen the code is used by a friend, e.g. the invited,\nBoth the invitee and invited receive a reward of 5 bonus retries, each with 50 point value, \n\nBonus retry can only be used one per game unless the player has invited 3 players who took part in a merchant offer at least once.\n\nWhen the invitee registers and makes a purchase related to a Win\u2019it offers.\nThe invitee can view the status of their invited friends, including when they joined, the status of their purchase (pending or confirmed), and the points earned from the referral. Can view the status of their invited friends, including when they joined, the status of their purchase (pending or confirmed), and the points earned from the referral.\n\nMerchant reporting\nThe merchant reporting feature allows merchants to view their performance metrics, including the number of players who have opted into their offers, the redemption rates of their offers, and the total transaction volume generated by their offers. They can also view detailed transaction histories and player profiles, as well as track their credits and bonuses. This helps merchants make data-driven decisions and optimize their marketing strategies for better engagement and revenue.\nDynamically adjusts the odds \nDynamic or adaptive odds' system is a type of betting system that adjusts the odds based on real-time data and events. Here are some key components that a dynamic odds' system would require:\nReal-time data monitoring: The system would need to constantly monitor relevant variables that can affect the outcome of the event. This could include factors such as score, possession percentage, and injuries to key players.\nMathematical algorithms: The system would need to use mathematical algorithms to calculate the updated probability of the event occurring based on the real-time data.\nOdds adjustment: Once the updated probability is calculated, the system would need to use a mathematical formula to convert it back into odds. This would adjust the odds to reflect the changing probabilities.\nCommunication with customers: The system would need to communicate any changes in the odds to customers in a clear and timely manner. This can help ensure that customers are aware of how the offer works and can make informed decisions about whether to participate.\n\nStand along campaigns \nOffer campaigns can be set up by merchant and each one is unique and will have its own merchant reporting for the campaign."

I've been in the ever circling vortex of self doubt, frustration, and loathing. It's no bueno. I know. If you don't mind lemme tell you a couple things. You can read em if you want, read em again later if you feel like it. But honestly man, if I spend all this time typing this out to you and you don't let it be a little tinder for your fire, well, you're just letting us both down. And you don't HAVE to do that. You don't HAVE to do anything. But you get to choose.\n\n(Who am I? My name\u2019s Ryan and I live in Canada. Just moved to a new city for a dream job that I got because of the rules below. I owe a lot of my success to people much cooler, kinder, more loving and greater than me. When I get the chance to maybe let a little bit of help out, it\u2019s a way of thanking them. )\n\nRule numero uno - There are no more zero days. What's a zero day? A zero day is when you don't do a single fucking thing towards whatever dream or goal or want or whatever that you got going on. No more zeros. I'm not saying you gotta bust an essay out everyday, that's not the point. The point I'm trying to make is that you have to make yourself, promise yourself, that the new SYSTEM you live in is a NON-ZERO system. Didnt' do anything all fucking day and it's 11:58 PM? Write one sentence. One pushup. Read one page of that chapter. One. Because one is non zero. You feel me? When you're in the super vortex of being bummed your pattern of behaviour is keeping the vortex goin, that's what you're used to. Turning into productivity ultimate master of the universe doesn't happen from the vortex. It happens from a massive string of CONSISTENT NON ZEROS. That's rule number one. Do not forget.\n\nLa deuxieme regle - yeah i learnt french. its a canadian thing. please excuse the lack of accent graves, but lemme get into rule number 2. BE GRATEFUL TO THE 3 YOU'S. Uh what? 3 me's? That sounds like mumbo jumbo bullshit. News flash, there are three you's homeslice. There's the past you, the present you, and the future you. If you wanna love someone and have someone love you back, you gotta learn to love yourself, and the 3 you's are the key. Be GRATEFUL to the past you for the positive things you've done. And do favours for the future you like you would for your best bro. Feeling like shit today? Stop a second, think of a good decision you made yesterday. Salad and tuna instead of Big Mac? THANK YOU YOUNGER ME. Was yesterday a nonzero day because you wrote 200 words (hey, that's all you could muster)? THANK YOU YOUNGER ME. Saved up some coin over time to buy that sweet thing you wanted? THANK YOU. Second part of the 3 me's is you gotta do your future self a favour, just like you would for your best fucking friend (no best friend? you do now. You got 2. It's future and past you). Tired as hell and can't get off reddit/videogames/interwebs? fuck you present self, this one's for future me, i'm gonna rock out p90x Ab Ripper X for 17 minutes. I'm doing this one for future me. Alarm clock goes off and bed is too comfy? fuck you present self, this one's for my best friend, the future me. I'm up and going for a 5 km run (or 25 meter run, it's gotta be non zero). MAKE SURE YOU THANK YOUR OLD SELF for rocking out at the end of every.single.thing. that makes your life better. The cycle of doing something for someone else (future you) and thanking someone for the good in your life (past you) is key to building gratitude and productivity. Do not doubt me. Over time you should spread the gratitude to others who help you on your path.\n\nRule number 3- don't worry i'm gonna too long didnt' read this bad boy at the bottom (get a pencil and piece of paper to write it down. seriously. you physically need to scratch marks on paper) FORGIVE YOURSELF. I mean it. Maybe you got all the know-how, money, ability, strength and talent to do whatever is you wanna do. But lets say you still didn't do it. Now you're giving yourself shit for not doing what you need to, to be who you want to. Heads up champion, being dissapointed in yourself causes you to be less productive. Tried your best to have a nonzero day yesterday and it failed? so what. I forgive you previous self. I forgive you. But today? Today is a nonzero masterpiece to the best of my ability for future self. This one's for you future homes. Forgiveness man, use it. I forgive you. Say it out loud.\n\nLast rule. Rule number 4, is the easiest and its three words. exercise and books. that's it. Pretty standard advice but when you exercise daily you actually get smarter. when you exercise you get high from endorphins (thanks body). when you exercise you clear your mind. when you exercise you are doing your future self a huge favour. Exercise is a leg on a three legged stool. Feel me? As for books, almost every fucking thing we've all ever thought of, or felt, or gone through, or wanted, or wanted to know how to do, or whatever, has been figured out by someone else. Get some books max. Post to reddit about not caring about yourself? Good first step! (nonzero day, thanks younger me for typing it out) You know what else you could do? Read 7 habits of highly successful people. Read \"emotional intelligence\". Read \"From good to great\". Read \u201cthinking fast and slow\u201d. Read books that will help you understand. Read the bodyweight fitness reddit and incorporate it into your workouts. (how's them pullups coming?) Reading is the fucking warp whistle from Super Mario 3. It gets you to the next level that much faster.\n\nThat\u2019s about it man. There\u2019s so much more when it comes to how to turn nonzero days into hugely nonzero days, but that\u2019s not your mission right now. Your mission is nonzero and forgiveness and favours. You got 36 essays due in 24 minutes and its impossible to pull off? Your past self let you down big time, but hey\u2026 I forgive you. Do as much as you can in those 24 minutes and then move on.\n\nI hope I helped a little bit max. I could write about this forever, but I promised myself I would go do a 15 minute run while listening to A. Skillz Beats Working Vol. 3. Gotta jet. One last piece of advice though. Regardless of whether or not reading this for the first time helps make your day better, if you wake up tomorrow, and you can\u2019t remember the 4 rules I just laid out, please, please. Read this again.\n\nHave an awesome fucking day \u263a\n\ntldr; 1. Nonzero days as much as you can. 2. The three you\u2019s, gratitude and favours. 3. Forgiveness 4. Exercise and books (which is a sneaky way of saying self improvement, both physical, emotional and mental)\n\nEdit: Wow reddit gold? Thanks! No idea what to do with it or whats the deal but many thanks!\n\nEdit2: Someone asked what I meant by \"much more when it comes to how to turn nonzero days into hugely nonzero days\". The long and short of it is a simple truth, but it's tough to TOTALLY UNDERSTAND AND PRACTICE. It's this: you become what you think. This doesnt mean if I think of a tree, I'll be oakin' it by august. It means that the WAY you think, the THINGS you think of, and the IDEAS YOU HOLD IN YOUR MIND defines the sum total that is you. You procrastinate all the time and got fear and worry goin on for something? You are becoming a procrastinator. You keep thinking about how much you want to run that 5 k race in the spring and finish a champion? Are ya keeping it in mind all the time? Is it something that is defining your ACTIONS and influencing you DECISIONS? If it is, then you're becoming the champion you're dreaming about. Dreaming about it makes it. Think and it shall be. But do not forget that action is thought's son. Thoughts without actions are nothing. Have faith in whatever it is you've steeled your mind to. Have faith and follow through with action.\n\nOk, Ryan that's a bunch of nice words n shit, but how does that help me turn slightly nonzero days into hugely nonzero days. Do you believe all these words you just read? Does it makes sense to you that you BECOME WHAT YOU THINK OF? Ask yourself: What do I think of? When you get home and walk in the door. (how quickly did you turn that laptop on? Did turning it on make you closer to your dreams? What would?) At the bus stop. Lunch break. What direction are you focusing your intentions on? If you're like I was a few years ago, the answer was either No direction, or whatever caught my eye at the moment. But no stress, forgive yourself. You know the truth now. And knowing the truth means you can watch your habits, read books on how you think and act, and finally start changing your behaviour. Heres an example: Feeling like bunk cause you had zero days or barely nonzero days? THINK ABOUT WHAT YOURE DOING. and change just a little bit more. in whatever positive direction you are choosing to go."

        "value": "how can i improve my oral presentation script?\n\nGood morning, everyone, my name is Cohen Beveridge. I\u2019m here to talk to you about how ideas around surveillance and control in the real world can inform our understanding of the film \u201cThe Truman Show\u201d. In The Truman Show, it\u2019s noticeable that the methods of surveillance and control used echo those in the real world. Real world ideas such as mass surveillance, subliminal societal control, and more extreme forms of control, inform our understanding of how these ideas are represented and exaggerated in the film. First, I\u2019ll be talking about how the film depicts an exaggeration of the increasing amount of mass surveillance in the real world, as well as the film\u2019s allusion to real-world surveillance states. Then I\u2019ll be talking about how aspects of the world around us are designed to subliminally control us, just like in the film. Finally, I\u2019ll be discussing the film\u2019s relevance to the more extreme ideas of emotionally manipulating children to control them, and an individual having godlike control.\nSurveillance is an aspect of the real world that The Truman Show represents in an extreme way. Truman is constantly being watched in every aspect of his daily life, which is evident in the invasive camera shots and unusual camera angles through which he is displayed. We first see Truman through a camera shot from behind the mirror in his bathroom, which is alarming because bathrooms are considered very private places. We also see intrusive camera shots on Truman while he's sleeping, while he thinks he\u2019s alone, and in every other aspect of his daily life. This idea of constant surveillance is a reference to real world ideas that in the modern day, cameras are everywhere, whether we know they are there or not. Due to advances in technology in recent years, it has become much easier and cheaper for governments, law enforcement agencies, and private companies to engage in mass surveillance, for reasons including national security, crime prevention, and marketing. Mass surveillance can cause issues like infringing on individuals\u2019 right to privacy but causes even more issues when it is conducted without their knowledge, like in The Truman Show. In the film, unusual camera angles such as from inside Truman\u2019s car radio and his pencil sharpener show us how Truman is being monitored in complete secrecy. Secret mass surveillance can be conducted by governments but can also be conducted by tech companies collecting individuals\u2019 data without their consent. It\u2019s also impossible to tell if the cameras and microphones on our phones and computers aren\u2019t just constantly watching and listening to us. In addition, tech companies sometimes sell personal data to third parties without consent, which is a less extreme version of how Truman\u2019s personal information is broadcasted to the whole world. Mass surveillance conducted by governments and tech companies exists in the real world is increasing in amount and secrecy. Because of this, we understand that the surveillance in The Truman Show is not just a fictional concept, but merely an exaggerated version of reality.\n\n\nWhile the film makes references to mass surveillance in the society we live in today, it also makes references to more severe systems of surveillance and control which exist in the real world. Because the surveillance is so extreme, it is linked to the idea of a surveillance state, which is a country where the government engages in pervasive surveillance of large numbers of its citizens and visitors. An example of this is modern-day China. The Chinese system of surveillance is one of the most advanced in the world. The government has a system of millions of cameras, equipped with facial recognition technology, that constantly tracks every Chinese citizen. This sort of system is not unlike how Truman is monitored in The Truman Show, and how his every movement is tracked through a network of cameras. An example of a more severe surveillance state is Nazi Germany. The Nazi Party\u2019s intelligence and security service aimed to keep every individual in Germany under constant supervision, like how Truman is supervised in the film. However, the Nazis also used methods to control their people, through spying, intimidation, and imprisonment. When the show\u2019s cast marches through the streets in search of Truman, backed by a snarling dog and the moon acting as a searchlight, it could be interpreted as an allusion to the methods that the Nazis used. Our ideas of real-world surveillance states like China and Nazi Germany help us understand the problematic nature of the extreme level of surveillance and control in the film.\nThe societal control that we are subjected to in the real world helps us to understand what Truman experiences in the film. Truman\u2019s life is controlled by the entire world around him. For example, in the travel agency, we see posters with messages warning against terrorists and disease, as well as an ominous poster of a plane being struck by lightning. What Truman sees is nothing out of the ordinary. What we see, through mise-en-scene, is a method used by the show to influence Truman and control his ideas about escape. Truman is also subjected to a similar sort of subliminal control when listening to the radio. For example, we hear the radio announcer say, \u201cwhy don\u2019t you forget the perils of flying, and let this music calm you down\u201d. When thinking about this idea in terms of the real world, we can reference the ideas of the French philosopher Gilles Deleuze. Deleuze theorised that the world we live in today is made up of what he called \u201csocieties of control\u201d. What this means is that control infiltrates every aspect of life, and that individuals are not coerced through external force, but are subjected to control through internalisation of societal norms and values. This is facilitated by images, messages, and advertisements, that shape individual desires and aspirations. This sort of idea is what allows us to understand how Truman\u2019s world has been designed to subliminally control his thoughts, through the travel agency posters and radio, as well as other aspects of his world. This form of control infiltrates his life wherever he goes, and makes Truman involuntarily believe that flying and travel is bad, and that it\u2019s normal to never leave Seahaven. Truman\u2019s access to things like posters and radio is just a way to control him by attempting to get rid of his desire to leave his carefully constructed world.\nTruman was also subjected to emotional manipulation at a young age when his father faked his death at sea. This is depicted using flashbacks with dark lighting, sad music, and slow motion, to convey the despair Truman feels about what happened. However, we know that this is just a mechanism employed by Christof and the show\u2019s producers to manipulate and subliminally control Truman by inducing a fear of water, and therefore removing his methods of escape. This is another form of Truman being subliminally controlled, but the idea of killing someone\u2019s father to traumatise them is an extreme variation. There\u2019s no situation in the real world where we would socially accept this sort of thing, but our knowledge that children can be manipulated in similar ways allows us to understand Christof\u2019s unethical reasoning behind the false death of Truman\u2019s father.\nThere is another level of control present in the film, which is the godlike control employed by Christof, which becomes especially prevalent at the end of the film. When Christof says, \u201ccue the sun\u201d, and causes day to break before it should be possible, his dialogue and command of the world represent a power which in the real world is not possible. When Christof hears that Truman may die in front of a live audience and says, \u201che was born in front of a live audience\u201d, he implies that he can both create and take life at will. The ability to create and take an individual\u2019s life is the highest level of control that one person can have over another, which in the real world we consider to be a godlike ability. Christof\u2019s allusion to ideas of a god in the real world are heightened when he speaks to Truman through beams of sunlight from the clouds. In the real world, our ideas of godlike control over the world inform our understanding of the allusions to these ideas and the unnatural control that Christof possesses.\nIn conclusion, the film The Truman Show depicts multiple methods of surveillance of control, and it is our real-world knowledge of these ideas that allow us to understand the references, allusions, and exaggerations of them. Mass surveillance, subliminal societal control, and more extreme forms of control are ideas that exist in the real world and give us the information we need to understand the film. With this information, it\u2019s easy to see that the film is showing us the reality of what surveillance and control in the real world is slowly becoming."

It was another busy day beginning. \n But way off alone, out by himself beyond boat and shore, Jonathan Livingston Seagull was practicing. A hundred feet in the sky he lowered his webbed feet, lifted his beak, and strained to hold a painful hard twisted curve through his wings. The curve meant that he would fly slowly, and now he slowed until the wind was a whisper in his face, until the ocean stood still beneath him. He narrowed his eyes in fierce concentration, held his breath, forced one ... single ... more ... inch ... of ... curve .... Then his feathers ruffled, he stalled and fell. \n Seagulls, as you know, never falter, never stall. To stall in the air is for them disgraced and it is dishonor. \n But Jonathan Livingston Seagull, unashamed, stretching his wings again in that trembling hard curve - slowing, slowing, and stalling once more - was no ordinary bird. \n Most gulls didn't bother to learn more than the simplest facts of flight \u00adhow to get from shore to food and back again. For most gulls, it is not flying that matters, but eating. For this gull, through, it was not eating that mattered, but flight. More than anything else, Jonathan Livingston Seagull loved to fly. \n This kind of thinking, he found, is not the way to make one's self popular with other birds. Even his parents were dismayed as Jonathan spent whole days alone, making hundreds of low-level glides, experimenting. \n He didn't know why, for instance, but when he flew at altitudes less than half his wingspan above the water, he could stay in the air longer, with less effort. His glides ended not with the usual feet-down splash into the sea, but with a long flat wake as he touched the surface with his feet tightly streamlined against his body. When he began sliding in to feet-up landings on the beach, then pacing the length of his slide in the sand, his parents were very much dismayed indeed. \nWhy, Jon, why?\" his mother asked. \"Why is it so hard to be like the rest of the flock, Jon? Why can't you leave low flying to the pelicans, the albatross? \n\"I don't mind being bone and feathers, Mum. I just want to know what I can do in the air and what I can't, that's all. I just want to know.\" \n\"See here, Jonathan,\" said his father, not unkindly. \"Winter isn't far away. Boats will be few, and the surface fish will be swimming deep. If you must study,. then study food, and how to get it. This flying business is all very well, but you can't eat a glide, you know. Don't you forget that the reason you fly is to eat.\"\n Jonathan nodded obediently. For the next few days he tried to be behave like the other gulls; he really tried, screeching and fighting with the flock around the piers and fishing boats, diving on scraps of fish and bread. But he couldn't make it work. \nIt's all so pointless, he thought, deliberately dropping a hard-won anchovy to a hungry old gull chasing him. I could be spending all this time learning to fly. There's so much to learn! \nIt wasn't long before Jonathan Gull was off by himself again, far out at see, hungry, happy, learning. \n The subject was speed, and in a week's practice he learned more about speed than the fastest gull alive. \n From a thousand feet, flapping his wings as hard as he could, he pushed over into a blazing steep dive toward the waves, and learned why seagulls don't make blazing steep power-dives. In just six seconds he was moving seventy miles per hour, the speed at which one's wing goes unstable on the upstroke. \n Time after time it happened. Careful as he was, working at the very peak of his ability, he lost control at high speed. \n Climb to a thousand feet. Full power straight ahead first, then push over, flapping, to a vertical dive. Then, every time, his left wing stalled on an upstroke, he'd roll violently left, stall his right wing recovering, and flick like fire into a wild tumbling spin to the right. \n He couldn't be careful enough on that upstroke. Ten times he tried, but all ten times, as he passed through seventy miles per hour, he burst into a churning mass of feathers, out of control, crashing down into the water. \n They key, he thought as last, dripping wet, must be to hold the wings still \n From two thousand feet he tried again, rolling into his dive, beak straight down, wings full out and stable from the moment he passed fifty miles per hour. It took tremendous strength, but it worked. In ten seconds he has blurred through ninety miles per hour. Jonathan had set a world speed record for seagulls!\n But victory was short-lived. The instant he began his pullout, the instant he changed the angle of his wings, he snapped into that same terrible uncontrolled disaster, and at ninety miles per hour it hit him like dynamite. Jonathan Seagull exploded in midair and smashed down into a brick-hard sea. \n When he came to, it was well after dark, and he floated in moonlight on the surface of the ocean. His wings were ragged bars of lead, but the weight of failure was even heavier on his back. He wished, feebly, that the weight could be just enough to drag him gently down to the bottom, and end it all. \n As he sank low in the water, a strange hollow voice sounded within him. There's no way around it. I am a seagull. I am limited by my nature. If I were meant to learn so much about flying, I'd have a falcon's short wings, and live on mice instead of fish. My father was right. I must forget this foolishness. I must fly home to the Flock and be content as I am, as a poor limited seagull. \n The voice faded, and Jonathan agreed. The place for a seagull at night is on shore, and from this moment forth, he vowed, he would be a normal gull. It would make everyone happier. \n He pushed wearily away from the dark water and flew toward the land, grateful for what he had learned about work-saving low-altitude flying. \n But no, he thought. I am done with the way I was, I am done with everything I learned. I am a seagull like every other seagull, and I will fly like one. So he climbed painfully to a hundred feet and flapped his wings harder, pressing for shore. \n He felt better for his decision to be just another one of the flock. there would be no ties now to the force that had driven him to learn, there would be no more challenge and no more failure. And it was pretty, just to stop thinking, and fly through the dark, toward the lights above the beach. \nDark! The hollow voice cracked in alarm. Seagulls never fly in the dark!\n Jonathan was not alert enough to listen. It's pretty, he thought. The moon and the lights twinkling on the water, throwing out little beacon-trails though the \n Get Down! Seagulls never fly in the dark! If you were meant to fly in the dark, you'd have the eyes f an owl! You'd have charts for brains! You'd have a falcon's short wings!\n There in the night, a hundred feet in the air, Jonathan Livingston Seagull \u00adblinked. His pain, his resolutions, vanished. \n Short Wings. A falcon's short wings!\n That's the answer! What a fool I've been! All I need is a tiny little wing, all I need is to fold most of my wings and fly on just the tips alone! Short wings!\n He climbed two thousand feet above the black sea, and without a moment for thought of failure and death, he brought his forewings tightly in to his body, left only the narrow swept daggers of his wingtips extended into the wind, and fell into a vertical dive. \n The wind was a monster roar at his head. Seventy miles per hour, ninety, a hundred and twenty and faster still. The wing-strain now at a hundred and forty miles per hour wasn't nearly as hard as it had been before at seventy, and with the faintest twist of his wingtips he eased out of the dive and shot above the waves, a grey cannonball under the moon. \n He closed his eyes to slits against the wind and rejoiced. A hundred forty miles per hour! and under control! If I dive from five thousand feet instead of two thousand, I wonder how fast... \n His vows of a moment before were forgotten, swept away in that great swift wind. Yet he felt guiltless, breaking the promises he had made himself. Such promises are only for the gulls that accept the ordinary. One who has touched excellence in his learning has no need of that kind of promise. \n By sunup, Jonathan Gull was practicing again. From five thousand feet the fishing boats were specks in the flat blue water, Breakfast Flock was a faint cloud of dust motes, circling. \n He was alive, trembling ever so slightly with delight, proud that his fear was under control. Then without ceremony he hugged in his forewings, extended his short, angled wingtips, and plunged directly toward the sea. By the time he had passed four thousand feet he had reached terminal velocity, the wind was a solid beating wall of sound against which he could move no faster. He was flying now straight down, at two hundred fourteen miles per hour. He swallowed, knowing that if his wings unfolded at that speed he'd be blown into a million tiny shreds of seagull. But the speed was power, and the"

Now, you have to code a PHP function to perform a registration ceremony in a webauthn system, here is the w3c documentation that will helps to do that :\n\nIn order to perform a registration ceremony, the Relying Party MUST proceed as follows:\n\nLet options be a new PublicKeyCredentialCreationOptions structure configured to the Relying Party's needs for the ceremony.\n\nCall navigator.credentials.create() and pass options as the publicKey option. Let credential be the result of the successfully resolved promise. If the promise is rejected, abort the ceremony with a user-visible error, or otherwise guide the user experience as might be determinable from the context available in the rejected promise. For example if the promise is rejected with an error code equivalent to \"InvalidStateError\", the user might be instructed to use a different authenticator. For information on different error contexts and the circumstances leading to them, see \u00a7\u202f6.3.2 The authenticatorMakeCredential Operation.\n\nLet response be credential.response. If response is not an instance of AuthenticatorAttestationResponse, abort the ceremony with a user-visible error.\n\nLet clientExtensionResults be the result of calling credential.getClientExtensionResults().\n\nLet JSONtext be the result of running UTF-8 decode on the value of response.clientDataJSON.\n\nNOTE: Using any implementation of UTF-8 decode is acceptable as long as it yields the same result as that yielded by the UTF-8 decode algorithm. In particular, any leading byte order mark (BOM) MUST be stripped.\n\nLet C, the client data claimed as collected during the credential creation, be the result of running an implementation-specific JSON parser on JSONtext.\n\nNOTE: C may be any implementation-specific data structure representation, as long as C\u2019s components are referenceable, as required by this algorithm.\n\nVerify that the value of C.type is webauthn.create.\n\nVerify that the value of C.challenge equals the base64url encoding of options.challenge.\n\nVerify that the value of C.origin matches the Relying Party's origin.\n\nIf C.topOrigin is present:\n\nVerify that the Relying Party expects that this credential would have been created within an iframe that is not same-origin with its ancestors.\n\nVerify that the value of C.topOrigin matches the origin of a page that the Relying Party expects to be sub-framed within.\n\nLet hash be the result of computing a hash over response.clientDataJSON using SHA-256.\n\nPerform CBOR decoding on the attestationObject field of the AuthenticatorAttestationResponse structure to obtain the attestation statement format fmt, the authenticator data authData, and the attestation statement attStmt.\n\nVerify that the rpIdHash in authData is the SHA-256 hash of the RP ID expected by the Relying Party.\n\nVerify that the UP bit of the flags in authData is set.\n\nIf the Relying Party requires user verification for this registration, verify that the UV bit of the flags in authData is set.\n\nIf the Relying Party uses the credential\u2019s backup eligibility to inform its user experience flows and/or policies, evaluate the BE bit of the flags in authData.\n\nIf the Relying Party uses the credential\u2019s backup state to inform its user experience flows and/or policies, evaluate the BS bit of the flags in authData.\n\nVerify that the \"alg\" parameter in the credential public key in authData matches the alg attribute of one of the items in options.pubKeyCredParams.\n\nVerify that the values of the client extension outputs in clientExtensionResults and the authenticator extension outputs in the extensions in authData are as expected, considering the client extension input values that were given in options.extensions and any specific policy of the Relying Party regarding unsolicited extensions, i.e., those that were not specified as part of options.extensions. In the general case, the meaning of \"are as expected\" is specific to the Relying Party and which extensions are in use.\nNOTE: Client platforms MAY enact local policy that sets additional authenticator extensions or client extensions and thus cause values to appear in the authenticator extension outputs or client extension outputs that were not originally specified as part of options.extensions. Relying Parties MUST be prepared to handle such situations, whether it be to ignore the unsolicited extensions or reject the attestation. The Relying Party can make this decision based on local policy and the extensions in use.\n\nNOTE: Since all extensions are OPTIONAL for both the client and the authenticator, the Relying Party MUST also be prepared to handle cases where none or not all of the requested extensions were acted upon.\n\nNOTE: The devicePubKey extension has explicit verification procedures, see \u00a7\u202f10.2.2.3.1 Registration (create()).\n\nDetermine the attestation statement format by performing a USASCII case-sensitive match on fmt against the set of supported WebAuthn Attestation Statement Format Identifier values. An up-to-date list of registered WebAuthn Attestation Statement Format Identifier values is maintained in the IANA \"WebAuthn Attestation Statement Format Identifiers\" registry [IANA-WebAuthn-Registries] established by [RFC8809].\n\nVerify that attStmt is a correct attestation statement, conveying a valid attestation signature, by using the attestation statement format fmt\u2019s verification procedure given attStmt, authData and hash.\nNOTE: Each attestation statement format specifies its own verification procedure. See \u00a7\u202f8 Defined Attestation Statement Formats for the initially-defined formats, and [IANA-WebAuthn-Registries] for the up-to-date list.\n\nIf validation is successful, obtain a list of acceptable trust anchors (i.e. attestation root certificates) for that attestation type and attestation statement format fmt, from a trusted source or from policy. For example, the FIDO Metadata Service [FIDOMetadataService] provides one way to obtain such information, using the aaguid in the attestedCredentialData in authData.\nAssess the attestation trustworthiness using the outputs of the verification procedure in step 21, as follows:\nIf no attestation was provided, verify that None attestation is acceptable under Relying Party policy.\n\nIf self attestation was used, verify that self attestation is acceptable under Relying Party policy.\n\nOtherwise, use the X.509 certificates returned as the attestation trust path from the verification procedure to verify that the attestation public key either correctly chains up to an acceptable root certificate, or is itself an acceptable certificate (i.e., it and the root certificate obtained in Step 22 may be the same).\n\nVerify that the credentialId is \u2264 1023 bytes. Credential IDs larger than this many bytes SHOULD cause the RP to fail this registration ceremony.\n\nVerify that the credentialId is not yet registered for any user. If the credentialId is already known then the Relying Party SHOULD fail this registration ceremony.\n\nNOTE: The rationale for Relying Parties rejecting duplicate credential IDs is as follows: credential IDs contain sufficient entropy that accidental duplication is very unlikely. However, attestation types other than self attestation do not include a self-signature to explicitly prove possession of the credential private key at registration time. Thus an attacker who has managed to obtain a user\u2019s credential ID and credential public key for a site (this could be potentially accomplished in various ways), could attempt to register a victim\u2019s credential as their own at that site. If the Relying Party accepts this new registration and replaces the victim\u2019s existing credential registration, and the credentials are discoverable, then the victim could be forced to sign into the attacker\u2019s account at their next attempt. Data saved to the site by the victim in that state would then be available to the attacker.\n\nIf the attestation statement attStmt verified successfully and is found to be trustworthy, then create and store a new credential record in the user account that was denoted in options.user, with the following contents:\ntype\ncredential.type.\n\nid\ncredential.id or credential.rawId, whichever format is preferred by the Relying Party.\n\npublicKey\nThe credential public key in authData.\n\nsignCount\nauthData.signCount.\n\ntransports\nThe value returned from response.getTransports().\n\nbackupEligible\nThe value of the BE flag in authData.\n\nbackupState\nThe value of the BS flag in authData.\n\nThe new credential record MAY also include the following OPTIONAL contents:\n\nattestationObject\nresponse.attestationObject.\n\nattestationClientDataJSON\nresponse.clientDataJSON.\n\nIf the attestation statement attStmt successfully verified but is not trustworthy per step 23 above, the Relying Party SHOULD fail the registration ceremony.\n\nNOTE: However, if permitted by policy, the Relying Party MAY register the credential ID and credential public key but treat the credential as one with self attestation (see \u00a7\u202f6.5.4 Attestation Types). If doing so, the Relying Party is asserting there is no cryptographic proof that the public key credential has been generated by a particular authenticator model. See [FIDOSecRef] and [UAFProtocol] for a more detailed discussion.\n\nVerification of attestation objects requires that the Relying Party has a trusted method of determining acceptable trust anchors in step 22 above. Also, if certificates are being used, the Relying Party MUST have access to certificate status information for the intermediate CA certificates. The Relying Party MUST also be able to build the attestation certificate chain if the client did not provide this chain in the attestation information."

        "value": "Below is the payment determination algorithm for a healthcare alternative payment model. Assume you have a dataset with simulated ACR, UAMCC, and DAH measure scores (n=1000). The variable that captures unique healthcare org ID is DCE\\_ID. Then create a Stata code to apply to this simulated dataset, to compute the Final Earn-Back Rate for every DCE. If a DCE has missing scores for all relevant quality measures, give them a P4P score=missing. Please use the benchmark information in \"Table 2-6. Hypothetical Benchmark Distributions for ACR and UAMCC for Comparison with Standard and New Entrant DCE Measure Scores\"\n -------1.1 Application of Quality Assessment to Final Financial Reconciliation\nThe process of determining the impact of quality measurement and performance on the PY Benchmark is summarized in this section using PY2022 as an example. The steps are as follows:\n\n\u2022 CMS develops Quality Benchmarks for each P4P measure.\n\u2022 Component Quality Scores are calculated: P4R Quality Measures are assessed, and P4P Quality Measures are compared against their Quality Benchmarks to determine performance levels.\n\u2022 Component Quality Scores are weighted to calculate the Total Quality Score.\n\u2022 (PY2023\u2013PY2026 only) CI/SEP criteria are assessed to determine the amount of the Quality Withhold to which the Total Quality Score will be applied.\n\u2022 (PY2023\u2013PY2026 only) HPP funds are distributed.\n\n1.1.1 Step 1. CMS Develops Quality Benchmarks for Each P4P Measure\nIn PY2022, ACR and UAMCC will have P4P components. These measures assess the occurrence of undesirable outcomes\u2014thus, lower measure scores represent better performance. Performance levels for each DCE are determined by comparing their Quality Measure scores with the relevant Quality Benchmark. The DCE earns a performance level for each measure based on where the measure score falls in comparison to the benchmark threshold values.\n\nTable 2-6 presents hypothetical Quality Benchmark distributions for Standard/New Entrant DCEs (using historical Medicare claims data) for both P4P measures. For example, a DCE with a measure score or risk-standardized readmission rate (RSRR) of 15.10% for ACR would be in the 50th percentile group for that measure (the score exceeds the threshold for the 60th percentile group but is less than the maximum threshold for the 50th percentile group). A DCE with a measure score or RSRR of 15.60% for ACR would be in the 20th percentile group for that measure (the score exceeds the threshold for the\n25th percentile group but is less than the maximum threshold for the 20th percentile group). A DCE with a measure score of 74.89 admissions per 100 person-years for UAMCC would be in the 10th percentile group (the score exceeds the threshold for the 15th percentile group but is less than the maximum threshold for the 10th percentile group).\n\nTable 2-6. Hypothetical Benchmark Distributions for ACR and UAMCC for Comparison with Standard and New Entrant DCE Measure Scores\n\nPercentile 5 10 15 20 25 30 40 50 60 70 80 90\nACR 16.34 15.99 15.79 15.68 15.57 15.47 15.31 15.18 15.08 14.95 14.82 14.6\nUAMCC 82.5 75.23 71.08 68.43 66.67 64.68 61.2 58.48 55.98 53.37 50.16 46.12\n\nPlease note that Table 2-6 presents an example only. These are not the final Quality Benchmarks and are not intended to provide an indication of the final Quality Benchmarks. Historically, Quality Benchmarks for other models have been released prior to the start of a given PY. However, observed and anticipated changes in utilization and outcomes resulting from coronavirus disease 2019 have made it inappropriate to use data from 2020 for Quality Benchmarking. Given the likelihood of ongoing impacts on current and future PYs, CMMI is taking a different approach for GPDC quality benchmarking.\n \n\nFor PY2021, GPDC Quality Benchmarks will not be released until June 2022 and will be based on a hybrid approach, combining historical and concurrent data from two discontinuous 12-month periods, the calendar years 2019 and 2021. A DCE\u2019s Final Earn-Back Rate for PY2021 will be determined during final reconciliation, which will occur in 2023.\n\nFor PY2022, GPDC Quality Benchmarks will shift to being based only on data from the 12-month period concurrent with the performance year. Starting with the first quarterly quality report for PY2022, CMMI will provide provisional quality benchmarks to DCEs in their quarterly reports, which will be calculated based on data from the same reporting period (i.e., April 1, 2021-March 31, 2022 for PY2022 Q1). The provisional benchmarks will be updated in each subsequent quarterly report with data from the same period being used to calculate DCE\u2019s performance. Because the DCE performance and benchmarks will be based on the same time-period and have the same exact risk adjustment coefficients, DCEs will have a more accurate picture from quarter to quarter of their performance relative to the benchmark. A DCE\u2019s Final Earn-Back Rate for PY2022 will be based on quality benchmarks calculated using data from calendar year 2022 and will be determined during final reconciliation, which will occur in 2023. As with the hybrid approach for PY2021, the use of concurrent benchmarks for PY2022 will avoid potential coronavirus disease 2019 impacts.\n\n1.1.2 Step 2. Component Quality Scores Are Calculated: P4R Quality Measures Are Assessed, and P4P Quality Measures Are Compared against Their Quality Benchmarks to Determine Performance Levels\nP4R Component: For PY2022, 4% of the 5% Quality Withhold is associated with P4R. The claims-based measures of ACR, UAMCC, and DAH (for High Needs Population DCEs only) comprise 2% of the Quality Withhold, and the CAHPS Measure comprises 2%. There are therefore two Component Quality Scores associated with P4R, one for the claims-based measures, and one for CAHPS.\n\u2022 All DCEs will meet the requirement for the claims-based measures and automatically earn a Component Quality Score of 100% for the portion of the withhold tied to the P4R claims-based measures in Table 2-3.\n\u2022 All DCEs that authorize a survey vendor to conduct the CAHPS Survey will receive a P4R Component Quality Score for CAHPS of 100%. DCEs that do not authorize a survey vendor to conduct the CAHPS Survey will receive a P4R Component Quality Score for CAHPS of 0%. DCEs that are exempt from CAHPS will have a single P4R Component Quality Score of 100%.\nP4P Component: The PY2022 P4P component will be the same as PY2021, which combines the ACR and UAMCC measures. The highest performance level (i.e., percentile) achieved for either Quality Measure determines the P4P Component Quality Score. Furthermore, the P4P component is considered pass/fail\u2014all DCEs with at least one measure at or exceeding the 30th percentile will pass and receive a 100% Component Quality Score.\n\nAs in PY2021, in PY2022, a sliding scale approach will be applied to DCEs that do not meet the 30th percentile threshold on at least one of the two measures. The sliding scale allows DCEs to earn back at\n \n\nleast a portion of the 1% withhold, based on their highest measure performance. The details of the sliding scales are presented in Table 2-7. In the example in Step 1 above, where a DCE achieved the 20th percentile for ACR and the 10th percentile for UAMCC, the DCE would receive a P4P Component Quality Score of 80%.\n\nTable 2-7. Sliding Scale Earn-Back for P4P Component Quality Score, PY2021 and PY2022\n\nPercentile Met P4P Component Quality Score\n\u2265 30th 100%\n25th to < 30th 95%\n20th to < 25th 80%\n15th to < 20th 60%\n10th to < 15th 40%\n5th to < 10th 20%\n< 5th 0%\n1.1.3 Step 3. Component Quality Scores Are Weighted to Calculate the Total Quality Score\nAfter assessing P4R measures and determining performance levels for each P4P measure, CMS calculates Component Quality Scores for each DCE. The component weight is the proportion of the overall Quality Withhold tied to that component. In PY2022, there are three Component Quality Scores. The first component is P4P, based on ACR and UAMCC. The P4P component has a weight of 1/5, contributing 1% out of the 5% Quality Withhold. The second component is P4R for claims-based measures and has a weight of 2/5, contributing 2% out of the 5% Quality Withhold. The third component is P4R for CAHPS and has a weight of 2/5, contributing 2% out of the 5% Quality Withhold. Note that additional P4P components (such as DAH) will be added in subsequent years.\n\nThe Total Quality Score is the percentage of the Quality Withhold eligible for earn-back that a DCE will actually earn back based on its quality performance and reporting. The Total Quality Score is calculated as the sum of the products of the Component Quality Scores and component weights, as shown in the equation below.\n\nTotal Quality Score = \u2211 (Component Quality Scores \\* Component Weights)\n\nIn our example above, the DCE receives a P4P Component Quality Score of 80% based on the sliding scale. The same DCE receives a P4R Component Quality Score for claims-based measures of 100%. This DCE also authorized a CAHPS Survey vendor, earning 100% of the P4R Component Quality Score for CAHPS. The P4P component has a weight of 1/5 and the P4R components each have a weight of 2/5. The Total Quality Score for this DCE is (80% \\* 1/5) + (100% \\* 2/5) + (100% \\* 2/5) = 96%.\n\n1.1.4 Step 4. Total Quality Score Is Multiplied by the Eligible Earn-Back Rate to Determine a DCE\u2019s\nFinal Earn-Back Rate\nIn PY2022, the Eligible Earn-Back Rate will be 5% for all DCEs. A DCE with a Total Quality Score of 96% will have a Final Earn-Back Rate of 4.8%. A DCE\u2019s Final Earn-Back Rate will be determined during final reconciliation, which will occur in 2023 for PY2022. The steps for the example described in this section, starting with Section 2.5, are summarized in Table 3-1."
