How much energy do GenAI models like LLMs and Diffusion models consume?

This README focuses on explaining how to run the benchmark yourself.
The actual leaderboard is here: https://ml.energy/leaderboard.

## Colosseum

We instrumented [Hugging Face TGI](https://github.com/huggingface/text-generation-inference) so that it measures and returns GPU energy consumption.
Then, our [controller](/spitfight/colosseum/controller) server receives user prompts from the [Gradio app](/app.py), selects two models randomly, and streams model responses back with energy consumption.

## Running the Benchmark

We open-sourced the entire benchmark with instructions here: [`./benchmark`](./benchmark)
