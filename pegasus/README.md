# Running benchmarks on multiple GPU nodes with Pegasus

[Pegasus](https://github.com/jaywonchung/pegasus) is an SSH-based multi-node command runner.
Different models have different verbosity, and benchmarking takes vastly different amounts of time.
Therefore, we want an automated piece of software that drains a queue of benchmarking jobs (one job per model) on a set of GPUs.

## Setup

### Install Pegasus

Pegasus needs to keep SSH connections with all the nodes in order to queue up and run jobs over SSH.
So you should install and run Pegasus on a computer that you can keep awake.

If you already have Rust set up:

```console
$ cargo install pegasus-ssh
```

Otherwise, you can set up Rust [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install), or just download Pegasus release binaries [here](https://github.com/jaywonchung/pegasus/releases/latest).

### Necessary setup for each node

Every node must have two things:

1. This repository cloned under `~/workspace/leaderboard`.
  - If you want a different path, search and replace in `spawn-containers.yaml`.
2. Model weights under `/data/leaderboard/weights`.
  - If you want a different path, search and replace in `setupspawn-containers.yaml` and `benchmark.yaml`.

### Specify node names for Pegasus

Modify `hosts.yaml` with nodes. See the file for an example.

- `hostname`: List the hostnames you would use in order to `ssh` into the node, e.g. `jaywonchung@gpunode01`.
- `gpu`: We want to create one Docker container for each GPU. List the indices of the GPUs you would like to use for the hosts.

### Set up Docker containers on your nodes with Pegasus

This spawns one container per GPU (named `leaderboard%d`), for every node.

```console
$ cd pegasus
$ cp spawn-containers.yaml queue.yaml
$ pegasus b
```

`b` stands for broadcast. Every command is run once on all (`hostname`, `gpu`) combinations.

## Benchmark

Now use Pegasus to run benchmarks for all the models across all nodes.

```console
$ cd pegasus
$ cp benchmark.yaml queue.yaml
$ pegasus q
```

`q` stands for queue. Each command is run once on the next available (`hostname`, `gpu`) combination.

## NLP-eval

Now use Pegasus to run benchmarks for all the models across all nodes.

```console
$ cd pegasus
$ cp nlp-eval.yaml queue.yaml
$ pegasus q
```

for some tasks, if the cuda memory of a single gpu is not enough, you can use more GPUs like follows â€”

1. create a larger docker with more gpus, e.g. 2 gpus:

```console
$ docker run -dit --name leaderboard_nlp_tasks --gpus '"device=0,1"' -v /data/leaderboard:/data/leaderboard -v $HOME/workspace/leaderboard:/workspace/leaderboard ml-energy:latest bash
```

2. then run the specific task with Pegasus or directly run with

```console
$ docker exec leaderboard_nlp_tasks python lm-evaluation-harness/main.py --device cuda --no_cache --model hf-causal-experimental --model_args pretrained={{model}},trust_remote_code=True,use_accelerate=True --tasks {{task}} --num_fewshot {{shot}}
```

change 'model', `task` and `shot` to specific tasks
