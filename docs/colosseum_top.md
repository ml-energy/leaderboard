> Enter the ML.ENERGY Colosseum, where language models duel with intellect, and your judgment tips the scales of victory.

### Rules of the Colosseum

- As the spectator, you'll decide the fates of two anonymous language models -- our gladiators.
- Your role is twofold: First, you vote for the model that delivered the best response to your prompt.
- Next, mighty [Zeus](https://ml.energy/zeus) will reveal which language model consumed more energy. Evaluate if its performance justified the energy consumption.
- Only after you cast votes will the models' identities be unveiled.
