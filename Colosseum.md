### Rules of Colosseum
- Participants will engage in a one-round conversation with two anonymous language models.
- Participants will vote for which model give better response.
- Participants will then assess and decide whether the energy consumed by the chosen model was justified based on its performance.
- The energy consumption is for the single-round model inference measured by [Zeus](https://ml.energy/zeus).
- The identities of the two models will only be revealed after the participant's second vote.
